1. PDF Text Extraction (Extract text from PDF)
2. Chunking and Preprocessing (Chunk documents into small, overlapping chunks for better retrieval.)
3. Embedding + Vector Store Setup (Store your chunked documents in a vector store for fast retrieval.)
4. RAG Setup (Combine retrieval and generation to answer questions.)
5. Multi-Agent Orchestration (
                                Each agent performs a task:
                                Extractor Agent: Loads and parses the PDF.
                                Summarizer Agent: Generates a TL;DR or section-wise summary.
                                Retriever Agent: Searches the vector DB.
                                QA Agent: Answers based on query and retrieved context.
                            )
                            [
                                LangGraph (LangChain's stateful multi-agent framework)
                                CrewAI (Agent-centric execution)
                                Autogen (if needed for more control)
                            ]
6. CLI/Web UI
7. Add caching and persistence (Cache previously answered queries (SQLite or Chroma metadata), Save summaries and indexes)

Optional
8. Metadata extractor from sources like PubMed
9. Multi-Paper QnA (Ingest multiple PDFs and compare them.)
10. Citation tracing (Answer “Which paper does it cite for X?”)
11. Plag or similarity detection


Best Practices
- Normalize and clean PDF text.
- Add metadata (e.g., paper title, section tags) to chunks.
- Log agent outputs for debugging.
- Store LLM outputs for analysis/improvements.
