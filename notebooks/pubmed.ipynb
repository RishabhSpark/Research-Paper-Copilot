      "Effective growth-promoting treatment with pituitary-derived human growth hormone (hGH) was first reported more than 60 years ago (1). In 1985, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was linked to the use of pituitary-derived hGH leading to its discontinuation, which, shortly thereafter, was followed by the first full regulatory approval worldwide of recombinant hGH (rhGH) by the US Food and Drug Administration and by the European Medicines Agency in the same year (2). Initially approved only for pediatric GH deficiency (GHD), rhGH treatment currently is approved, depending on the country/region, for 8 indications in children (GHD, Prader-Willi syndrome [PWS], children born small for gestational age [SGA], Turner syndrome [TS], Noonan syndrome, idiopathic short stature [ISS], chronic renal failure [CRF], and short stature homeobox-containing gene deficiency [SHOX-D]); and 3 in adults (GHD, short bowel syndrome, and HIV wasting syndrome). Various registries/postmarketing surveillance databases were developed to follow rhGH-treated pediatric patients for long-term efficacy and safety in real-world clinical settings, and, in particular, to provide information regarding potential rare serious adverse consequences of rhGH therapy, including recurrent or new malignancies in children with preexisting malignancies, development of intracranial hypertension, unmasking of (type 2) diabetes mellitus, induction of stroke, and a possible association with increased overall mortality (3–7).\n",
      "\n",
      "KIGS (Kabi/Pfizer International Growth Database) was an investigator driven and pharmaceutical company–supported surveillance study (8) first established as a survey in Sweden to determine the long-term safety and treatment outcomes of pediatric rhGH therapy (Genotropin [somatropin]; Pfizer). It started as a 5-year follow up of 500 patients from 3 countries in 1987, with enrollment quickly increasing to 5000 patients from 14 countries by 1989 (8), and continuing to evolve into a large outcomes research database of more than 80 000 rhGH-treated children with growth disorders from more than 50 countries by the time of data-lock June 30, 2012 (9). The database allows for analyses of relationships between clinical status, dosage schedule, treatment with rhGH before KIGS enrollment, and response to treatment. Prediction models have been developed based on KIGS results for individualized pediatric rhGH treatment to optimize management throughout the course of treatment and transition from pediatric to adult care. The large patient population enables evaluation of growth responses in children with rare growth disorders and comparisons of newly diagnosed patients with others who have the same established diagnosis. It has also contributed to our basic knowledge of growth, growth disorders, and rhGH treatment of pediatric patients through exploratory analyses of the collected study data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The objective of the present report was to analyze and summarize the accumulated safety and efficacy data on rhGH-treated patients in KIGS until its closure, with follow-up in some cases for more than 18 years, and to compare and contrast our findings with those of other previously published, large rhGH registries/postmarketing surveillance databases (5, 10–14).\n",

      "Children with growth disorders who were treated with rhGH (Genotropin [somatropin]; Pfizer) according to approved indications or as prescribed by physicians in medical practice were enrolled. Patients who started with another rhGH brand, but switched to Genotropin, also were enrolled in KIGS. The treating physician diagnosed the specific growth disorder, which subsequently was categorized according to the KIGS Etiology Classification List (15) (Supplementary Table 1) (16). Treatment dosing and schedule were at the discretion of each physician. Safety and growth data were collected during patients’ routine clinical visits and entered using case report forms at the sole discretion of investigators and analyzed without further modification. Participation in any blinded clinical trial was not allowed while participating in KIGS. The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consents/assents were obtained from participants and their parents before study entry, according to the regulatory standards of the local institution or country at that time.\n",

      "All adverse events (AEs; defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient) and serious AEs (SAEs; defined as any AE that is life-threatening, is an important medical event, or results in death, hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization, disability/permanent damage, or congenital anomaly/birth defect) were collected regardless of their relationship with rhGH. Coding of AEs and SAEs was initially based on the World Health Organization Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART) (17) and was later changed to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ classes (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) (MedDRA, version 14.1) after the launch of MedDRA (18). In MedDRA coding, “neoplasm” and “cancer” terms are both covered by the MedDRA SOC “Neoplasms benign, malignant, or unspecified.” “Neoplasm” terms are used to code for tumors that could be benign, malignant, or unspecified, whereas “cancer” is used for malignancy events, based on medical coders’ interpretation; coders are cautioned against assigning “tumor” events as “cancer” unless it is clear that malignancy is present. Causal relationship of AEs or SAEs with rhGH treatment was determined by investigators based on their opinions without central adjudication. Auxological data, including height, near-adult height (NAH), weight, and body mass index (BMI), were collected for the efficacy analysis.\n",

      "**Statistics**\n",
      "\n",
      "The safety cohort included all patients who received at least one dose of rhGH after KIGS enrollment (Fig. 1). Efficacy of rhGH treatment was analyzed in patients who had been treated for 1 year or more and completed a height assessment at year 1 (± 30 days) (see Fig. 1). The NAH subgroup comprises patients who received rhGH for 5 years or more (≥ 2 years of prepubertal treatment) and achieved NAH, which was defined by height velocity less than 2 cm/year during the last year and chronological age greater than 14 years for females and greater than 16 years for males (see Fig. 1). To evaluate the potential bias by the loss of patients from the safety to the efficacy cohort, a stepwise, multivariable logistic regression model was fitted for all the demographic variables, excluding variables that were not significant using the PROC LOGISTIC procedure in the SAS analytics software (SAS) (19). The effect on first-year height velocity of not including all rhGH-treated patients in the efficacy cohort was then analyzed with forward selection linear regression and the SAS REG procedure by using a model controlled for the significant dropout factors.\n",

      "Continuous data are presented as medians (10th-90th percentiles) unless noted otherwise, and categorical data are presented as proportions of patients. Patients with missing values of a particular end point were excluded from the analysis for that end point. Frequencies of SAEs and death were compared among subgroups defined by patient characteristics. Growth outcomes were summarized for each diagnostic group. SD score (SDS) was calculated based on the Swiss references (Prader) according to chronological age- and sex-matched values for height (20) and according to Cole et al for BMI (21) except for the analysis comparing growth outcomes from different regions, which used the Japanese references (22) for outcomes from Japan. Mid-parental height (MPH) SDS was calculated according to Cole’s formula (MPH-SDS = [mother’s height-SDS + father’s height-SDS]/1.61) (23). Start of puberty was defined by Tanner breast stage II in girls and testicular volume 4 mL in boys (24, 25). Auxological data at different time points (rhGH start, year 1, puberty onset, and NAH) were compared in each diagnostic group among NAH patients. Efficacy also was compared by sex. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4) (SAS Institute Inc). A P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were exploratory and P values were not corrected for multiple comparisons.\n",

      "The safety cohort included 83 803 children with growth disorders from 52 countries treated with rhGH. Of all patients, 62.2% were from Europe, 20.0% from the United States, 13.2% from Asia, and 4.7% from other parts of the world (Table 1). The United States, Germany, and Japan were the countries with the highest numbers of patients (16 737 [20.0%], 11 488 [13.7%], and 10 525 [12.6%], respectively). Additionally, Germany, the United States, France, and Japan were the countries with the longest follow-up in terms of patient-years (PY) (50 013; 46 254; 35 748; and 30 404 PY, respectively). Most patients were White (70%) and male (58%). In KIGS, children started rhGH treatment later in childhood (median age 10.7 years [range, 4.6-14.9]), and most (46.9%) were treated for idiopathic GHD (IGHD) (see Table 1). The initial dose of rhGH varied by diagnosis, with medians ranging from 0.17 mg/kg/wk (range, 0.08-0.26 mg/kg/wk) for craniopharyngioma to 0.33 mg/kg/wk (range, 0.15-0.39 mg/kg/wk) for CRF (Supplementary Table 2) (16). Duration of rhGH treatment in KIGS was 2.7 years (range, 0.3-7.2 years) (277 267 PY), and KIGS observation period was 3.1 years (range, 0.5-8.2 years) (322 576 PY) (see Table 1); neither duration differed by sex. In the safety cohort, 10 685 (12.8%) patients were treated for 6 months or less, 7143 (8.5%) for more than 6 months and 1 year or less, and 65 975 (78.7%) for more than 1 year.\n",

Of the 28 519 rhGH-treated patients excluded from the efficacy cohort (see Fig. 1), 17 828 had received less than 1 year of rhGH and 10 691 were missing height data at year 1. By linear regression modeling, age at rhGH start and maximum GH peak level were identified as the variables with a partial R-square equal to or greater than 5% (contribution to the total variability in height velocity explained). The effect of the missing data from the excluded patients on overall height velocity was calculated to be approximately −0.06 cm/year based on the differences between the safety and efficacy cohorts in median age and maximum GH peak level at rhGH start.\n",

The incidence rate of all-causality AE was 94.2 per 1000 PY. Drug discontinuation (temporary, permanent, or delayed) caused by AEs occurred in 1.6% of patients, and in 0.6% due to potential treatment-related AEs. The most common types of disorders (MedDRA SOC) for AEs were infections and infestations, which were reported in 3162 (3.8%) patients and more prevalent in children younger than 10 vs 10 years or older at rhGH start (5.8% vs 2.2%; P < .0001). AEs categorized in the SOC neoplasms as benign, malignant, and unspecified were reported in 842 (1%) patients. The most commonly reported AE by MedDRA PT was headache (all-causality in 1.2% and treatment related in 0.4%), followed by scoliosis (0.6% and 0.2%) (see Table 2), which was more prevalent in the PWS group (6.3%) than other groups. Multivariable analysis showed that the probability of reporting headache was significantly affected by sex (P = .0318), age at rhGH start, diagnosis, treatment duration, and initial or mean rhGH dose (P < .0001 for all except for sex); the probability was higher in females, younger patients, or patients with craniopharyngioma (Supplementary Table 5) (16). Craniopharyngioma AEs (mostly recurrent or worsening) were reported in 0.2% of all patients and considered related to rhGH treatment in 0.1% (see Table 2). In the craniopharyngioma diagnostic group, 11.9% of patients had a craniopharyngioma AE.

No effect of rhGH dose on the frequency of SAEs was observed within each diagnostic group except for the IGHD group; the frequency of all-causality SAEs was significantly higher in IGHD patients with a higher (≥third quartile) vs lower (≤first quartile) mean rhGH dose during participation in KIGS (Supplementary Table 7 (16)). Overall, the frequency of all-causality and treatment-related SAEs were lower in the IGHD vs congenital GHD diagnostic groups (1.9% vs 6.4% for all-causality; 0.3% vs 0.6% for treatment related; see Table 3). In both groups, statistically significant differences were observed by baseline maximum GH peak level, with higher SAE frequency in the less than 5 µg/L subgroup; however, such a correlation was not found for treatment-related SAEs (Supplementary Table 8) (16).

Pubertal patients (pubertal at treatment start or entered puberty during year 1) had somewhat higher initial height-SDS vs prepubertal patients (see Table 5). After 1 year of treatment, height-SDS increased in all diagnostic groups. Median gain in height-SDS in prepubertal patients was the greatest with congenital GHD (1.01 [0.15 to 2.22]), while those with extracranial malignancy had the smallest gain (0.38 [−0.06 to 0.86]) (see Table 5).

Median total gain in NAH-SDS was greater than 0 in all diagnostic groups, except for patients with medulloblastoma (−0.13 [−1.14 to 1.10]).

Longitudinal analysis showed larger height-SDS gains at puberty onset than year 1 for all diagnoses (see Fig. 3B). However, a decrease in delta height-SDS from puberty onset to NAH was observed in almost all diagnostic groups (see Fig. 3B). For patients with medulloblastoma or extracranial malignancy, median delta height-SDS at NAH was lower vs year 1 (see Fig. 3B). Height velocity-SDS was the highest at year 1, dropped to approximately 1 SD at puberty onset for most diagnoses, and remained similar at NAH (Fig. 3C). Changes in BMI-SDS over time were generally small (Fig. 3D). Median BMI-SDS was the highest in patients with PWS at all 4 time points evaluated, but remained less than +2.0 SD; it was lower at year 1 and puberty onset, but was similar at NAH, when compared with baseline (see Fig. 3D).\n",

Girls with PWS also started puberty at a similarly young age (10.8 years [8.2-13.3]), although boys with PWS started puberty later (13.6 years; P = .0004 vs girls with PWS). Additionally, girls had more prepubertal gains in height-SDS than boys in most of the diagnostic groups (see Tables 6 and 7). Total gains in NAH-SDS were significantly higher in girls vs boys diagnosed with IGHD (P < .0001), neurosecretory dysfunction (P = .0079), congenital GHD (P < .0001), medulloblastoma (P = .0068), other cranial tumors (P = .0085), ISS (P = .0056), and other syndromes (P = .0006).\n",

      "Responses to rhGH were compared between patients in Europe, the United States, and Japan (which comprised > 90% of the full KIGS cohort). Among the 6 main indications for rhGH therapy, TS, PWS, CRF, and SGA were excluded from the analysis as fewer than 35 patients reached NAH in these groups from at least 1 of the 3 geographical areas; outcomes were compared for patients with IGHD and ISS (Supplementary Table 12) (16). Initial rhGH dose varied by area, being lowest in Japan and highest in the United States for both diagnoses. Japanese patients started treatment earlier than US and European patients. Median delta height-SDS was the smallest in Japan at year 1 regardless of puberty status and at puberty onset for both diagnostic groups. Patients with IGHD in the United States and Europe compared to those in Japan had higher NAH-SDS (approximately −1 SD vs −2 SD) and total gains in NAH-SDS (approximately 2 SD vs 1 SD). In patients with ISS, median NAH-SDS was the highest in US patients and similar between Japanese and European patients, while total gains in NAH-SDS were similar across the 3 areas. However, numbers of patients in the ISS group were low at NAH in Japan and the United States.\n",

      "**Discussion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Data on the full cohort of patients in KIGS showed that rhGH treatment was safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients with growth disorders as prescribed in real-world settings over a median observation period of 3 years. AEs/SAEs and deaths occurred at low frequencies, and the majority were assessed by investigators as not related to rhGH. rhGH treatment also was shown to be effective, as median height-SDS increased after 1 year of its use in all diagnostic groups both for prepubertal and pubertal patients. Total gains in height-SDS from treatment start to NAH were greater than 0 in most diagnostic groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Safety**\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall AE incidence rate of 94/1000 PY in the full KIGS cohort is lower than those in recent reports from the Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study (GeNeSIS; 175.3/1000 PY) (5) and the PATRO Children study (152.3/1000 PY) (13), which, similar to KIGS, collected all AEs regardless of causal relationship with rhGH treatment. However, given the nature of observational studies, the AE rate may be underestimated because of underreporting. Consistent with the findings in other surveillance studies (Supplementary Table 13 [16]) (5, 10, 26), SAE frequency varied largely by diagnosis, and was more prevalent in patients with organic GHD (congenital GHD, craniopharyngioma, medulloblastoma, other cranial tumors, and extracranial malignancy combined) and CRF, likely due to the preexisting risks with these diagnoses. A higher SAE frequency may be associated with a longer duration of rhGH exposure, although care should be taken when interpreting the statistical inferences, as small-magnitude differences could be statistically significant because of the large sample size.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most prevalent AEs/SAEs in KIGS were generally common childhood illness or conditions associated with the underlying diagnoses. The most common AE (by MedDRA PT) was headache, which is a frequent complaint in children (27) and may be associated with intracranial hypertension. Younger patients or patients with craniopharyngioma had higher probability of reporting headache, in line with a previous KIGS report (28). The second most common AE was scoliosis, which is a common feature of patients with PWS or TS even when untreated and is not necessarily associated with rhGH treatment (3). As expected, we found that scoliosis was more commonly reported in patients with PWS than in patients with other indications. Other side effects that may be considered related to the use of rhGH, such as benign intracranial hypertension and epiphysiolysis, were infrequent in KIGS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous reports of increased risks of mortality and hemorrhagic stroke after a mean follow-up of 17 years in French young adults with childhood rhGH treatment for GHD, ISS, or SGA from the Safety and Appropriateness of Growth hormone treatments in Europe (SAGhE) study raised safety concerns about pediatric rhGH therapy (29, 30). However, data from the entire data set of all 8 countries in SAGhE (7) and those from other rhGH registries of patients who underwent rhGH treatment during childhood did not support an association between rhGH use and premature death or stroke (5, 13, 14, 31–33). The increased mortality for the French SAGhE cohort compared with the general population was likely attributable to underlying etiologies (IGHD, ISS, SGA) rather than rhGH treatment. Our data in KIGS are reassuring, as intracranial hemorrhage events occurred at low frequencies in the full KIGS cohort and death in only 0.4% of patients during the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our present analysis showed overall low frequencies of diabetes among 83 803 rhGH-treated children (35 type 1, 21 type 2, and 37 unspecified). Data from large observational studies, including a previous KIGS report on 23 333 patients, found no increased risk of type 1 diabetes during rhGH therapy (5, 10, 34); while the incidence of type 2 diabetes was higher than expected, it was likely driven by previous patient predisposition (10, 34). It is therefore important to monitor glucose homeostasis in patients with risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes when treating with rhGH (35).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical evidence does not support an association of childhood rhGH therapy with neoplasia nor an increased risk of cancer recurrence in low-risk patients (36). A previous KIGS analysis assessing cancer incidence after a mean 3.6 years of rhGH exposure found no evidence of increased cancer risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 1.26; 95% CI, 0.86-1.78) (37), which was corroborated by the results from both GeNeSIS (5) and the National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS) (10). Although the risk of all-site cancer for patients with a history of childhood rhGH treatment was significantly increased in SAGhE (SIR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9-2.6), that for patients with noncancer initial diagnoses was not (SIR 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6) (38). However, the same SAGhE report noted significantly increased risks for bone and bladder cancer in patients without prior cancer, suggesting potential effects of rhGH therapy on these cancer types (38). It should be noted, though, that the SAGhE study followed patients for an extended period of time into adulthood (∼ 15 years per patient), even after discontinuation of rhGH treatment (38), which allowed for detection of slow developing events during follow-up. In the present report, neoplasm AEs were reported in 1% of patients, comparable to the 1.6% reported in the PATRO Children study (13). Additionally, bone tumor events in KIGS were rare. Craniopharyngioma recurred in 11.9% of patients with that diagnosis, in agreement with the previously reported rate (11.7%) in KIGS after a median rhGH exposure of 2.8 years (39) and comparable to those observed in NCGS (8.7%) (10) and in GeNeSIS (13.7%) (5). Longer follow-up of KIGS patients and comparison with untreated patients would be necessary to better assess the incidence of cancer or tumor recurrence and its causal relationship with rhGH therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Efficacy**\n",
      "\n",
      "Response to first-year rhGH treatment is considered an important indicator of future gains in height (40, 41). The efficacy of rhGH was shown in our analysis by positive prepubertal gains in height-SDS after 1 year of treatment in all diagnostic groups. These results are consistent with previous KIGS analyses of patients treated for GHD, TS, SGA, and PWS (42, 43), and are also in line with findings from postmarketing studies of other pediatric rhGH therapies (12, 13, 26, 44). Patients with extracranial malignancy had the smallest height-SDS gain at year 1, which could be at least partially related to the later initiation of rhGH vs other groups. Multiple regression analyses have revealed an inverse association between first-year growth response and age at rhGH start in children with GHD, ISS, and SGA, and girls with TS (45–47). Additionally, prior irradiation and body site of irradiation treatment could also affect growth responses to rhGH (48).\n",
      "\n",
      "At NAH, patients in most diagnostic groups attained heights within the normal range (median height-SDS > –2), and the majority achieved MPH±1.5 SDS. Height-SDS gains were observed at puberty onset and at NAH both for patients with GHD and those with normal GH secretion, although patients with medulloblastoma had an overall loss in height-SDS at NAH vs rhGH start, despite age of treatment onset and rhGH dosage being comparable to patients with IGHD. Poor height response was also noted in a previous KIGS report on 113 patients with medulloblastoma who were rhGH treated until NAH (49). Relatively early puberty, prior craniospinal irradiation or chemotherapy, and/or cautious rhGH dosing could all affect the height response in patients with medulloblastoma. However, it is important to note that growth performance appears to be worse without rhGH treatment in this group of patients (50).\n",
      "\n",
      "Some differences in growth response by patient characteristics were found. In general, girls appeared to have more prepubertal or total gains in height-SDS than boys. Timing of puberty initiation was not accelerated by rhGH treatment, but was slightly delayed compared to the estimated age of 9 to 11 years for girls and 10 to 12 years for boys in the general population (51, 52). We also found a geographical area–specific difference in growth outcomes; the smaller gains in NAH-SDS in Japanese patients vs US and European patients may be caused by an ethnic difference and/or by the lower rhGH doses given to Japanese patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Limitations and Strengths**\n",
      "\n",
      "Our study has limitations that are inherent to observational studies. Safety data reporting was at the discretion of investigators, and biases cannot be excluded because of AE underreporting and the lack of additional appraisal of causal relationships between AEs and rhGH treatment. Challenges in AE coding with MedDRA (eg, an AE being coded as different PTs, misinterpretation or bias by the medical coder) may also lead to inconsistency in AE reporting and potential underestimations of certain AEs (53, 54). Additionally, changes in GH assays over the time period, different stimulation tests and cutoffs used, and nonstandardized categorization may have led to inconsistencies in diagnoses; and some confounders (eg, adherence, socioeconomic factors, concomitant use of medications, heterogeneity of data by country) were not considered in our analysis. Approximately one-third of KIGS patients in the safety cohort were excluded from the efficacy analysis, which could also cause patient selection bias, although its effect on efficacy outcomes was estimated to be limited. Additionally, a single set of standards (Swiss references) was used in the efficacy analysis and the responses of patients of certain ethnicities/countries could be underestimated. In KIGS, patients were followed during pediatric rhGH treatment only, while ongoing, longer-term surveillance of these patients with posttreatment data is important to reveal longer-term sequelae such as cancer and cardiometabolic conditions as individuals attain ages at which these events occur more commonly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, data from KIGS reflect real-life clinical practice situations that are complementary to clinical trials of rhGH therapy. In KIGS, a total of 83 803 patients were recruited globally and received rhGH, representing the largest cohort of rhGH-treated children studied to date. This large patient population and a long total observation of 322 576 PY makes it possible to collect rare events that cannot be observed in clinical trials. Patients were treated for a wide range of growth disorders and had characteristics representative of children with impaired growth commonly seen in clinical practice. Furthermore, additional classification of patients with GHD to different diagnostic groups in the present analysis allows for a more detailed review and comparison of the safety and efficacy by underlying disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Data compiled in KIGS, the largest and longest running global database of rhGH-treated children, complement results from clinical trials and confirm the safety and efficacy of pediatric rhGH therapy as used in clinical practice. The results for the full KIGS cohort of 83 803 patients with a follow-up of 322 576 PY reinforce that pediatric rhGH therapy effectively increases short-term height gain and adult height for patients with GHD and non-GHD conditions, with no new SAEs recognized.\n"
