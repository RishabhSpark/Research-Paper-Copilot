One hundred and fifty years later, Heinrich\\nE. Merck, a friend and collabo-\\nrator of Justus Liebig, took\\nover the family business and\\nbegan its conversion to a\\nmanufacturer of pharmaceuti-\\ncals and fine chemicals.  The\\ncompany, E. Merck, became a\\nmajor producer of alkaloids,\\nincluding morphine, codeine,\\nand cocaine (1).\\nThroughout the 19th cen-\\ntury, E. Merck exported prod-\\nucts to the US, but it did not\\nhave a sales or distribution of-\\nfice in this country.  Late in the\\ncentury, Lehn & Fink, E.\\nMerck’s US distributor, used E.\\nMerck labels on inferior non-\\nMerck products.  In an effort\\nto protect its American inter-\\nests and its good name, E.\\nMerck opened its own sales of-\\nfice in New York in 1887.\\nTheodore Weicker, who had\\nbeen with the firm in\\nDarmstadt for 10 years, was\\nplaced in charge of the New\\nYork office.\\nIn 1891 the firm decided it was time for a member\\nof the Merck family to begin tending the company’s\\nbusiness in the US, and the company sent George Merck\\n(Fig.1), Heinrich Merck’s\\ngrandson, to New York.\\nGeorge, who was only 23 at\\nthe time, had already spent\\nseven years being trained in\\nthe family business.  When he\\narrived in the US, he founded\\nMerck & Co. in partnership\\nwith Theodore Weicker.  In the\\nbeginning the company con-\\ncentrated on the importation of\\ndrugs and chemicals, primarily\\nthose of the parent company,\\nE. Merck.  The intent, how-\\never, must have been eventu-\\nally to establish a manufactur-\\ning presence in the US.  In\\n1903 Theodore Weicker sold\\nhis share of the business to\\nGeorge Merck and, with an-\\nother partner, purchased E. R.\\nSquibb & Sons (1, 2).\\nMerck & Co. had to en-\\ndure a major US depression\\n(1892-1895); but by 1896 the\\ncompany occupied its own\\nnew building at University\\nPlace and 8th Street in New\\nFigure 1.  George Merck holding his two-year-\\nold son, George W. Merck in Darmstadt,\\nGermany, 1896.\\n2\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nYork City, and in\\n1897 it opened a\\nvery stylish phar-\\nmacy on the north\\nside of the new\\nbuilding (Fig. 2).\\nMerck’s best cus-\\ntomers, the German\\ndruggists in New\\nYork and vicinity,\\nwere irate at this en-\\ncroachment by their\\nsupplier.  After two\\nyears, George Merck\\nbowed to the de-\\nmands of his custom-\\ners and closed his el-\\negant apothecary (3).\\nBy 1897 Merck\\n& Co. had annual\\nsales of over $1 mil-\\nlion.  George Merck purchased 120 acres of wooded\\ncountryside near Rahway, NJ in February, 1900; in 1903,\\nshortly after he became a US citizen in 1902, the com-\\npany began manufacturing some of its own chemicals\\nin a plant built on the Rahway property.  Merck & Co.\\nalso began manufacturing in St. Louis in 1903, in a plant\\nthat was first leased and later (1905) purchased from\\nHerf and Frerichs.  This plant had already been produc-\\ning iodides and other staples of the pharmaceutical in-\\ndustry.  Manufacturing in St. Louis was abandoned in\\n1908, but the site continued to serve as the St. Louis\\nbranch of Merck & Co. and was used as a distribution\\ncenter for the Midwest and western US.\\nMerck & Co. was no longer merely a branch of the\\nGerman company.  It incorporated in New York in 1908\\nand gradually expanded its product line of American-\\nmade narcotics — including morphine and cocaine.  By\\n1910 sales had exceeded $3 million, and in 1911, Merck\\nset up its own subsidiary in Canada; but there were still\\nvery strong ties to Germany.  Most of the production\\nwas carried out according to German manufacturing\\nprocesses; German immigrants were often used in the\\nplants, and E. Merck was still the majority stockholder\\nin the American company.\\nIn 1917, when the US entered World War I, George\\nMerck was forced to break formal ties with the German\\nbranch of the family and with E. Merck.  He voluntarily\\nturned over almost 80% of Merck stock, E. Merck’s share\\nof the company, to the Alien Property Custodian.  In\\n1919, the Property\\nCustodian decided to\\nsell the Merck stock at\\npublic auction, much\\nto the dismay of\\nGeorge Merck.  Merck\\ncalled upon and re-\\nceived the support of\\ntwo investment bank-\\ning \\ncompanies,\\nGoldman Sachs and\\nLehmann Brothers.\\nThere were five bid-\\nders at the auction.\\nMonsanto started the\\nbidding at 2.4 million\\ndollars, but 25 min-\\nutes later George\\nMerck once again had\\ncomplete control of\\nthe company at a cost\\nof 3.75 million dollars (4).\\nMerck continued to grow in the early 1920s and by\\n1925, when George Merck, warned of poor health,\\npassed on the presidency to his 31-year-old son, George\\nWilhelm, Merck & Co., Inc. was one of the “Big Three”\\nfine chemical producers in the US with sales of  $6.1\\nmillion (5, 6).  The senior Merck died a year later, on\\nOctober 21, 1926 at the age of 59.\\nDespite the profitability, George Merck had heavily\\nmortgaged the company when he purchased the shares\\nfrom the Alien Property Custodian.  He had financed\\nthe purchase with the sale of preferred stock (7); and,\\naccording to Adolph Rosengarten, Jr., a former director\\n(1932-1942, 1946-1974) and the largest Merck stock-\\nholder, by 1925 or 1926, Merck was in arrears on the\\npreferred stock (8).  As luck would have it, the four\\nRosengarten brothers, Adolph, Frederick, George, and\\nJoseph, the owners of Powers-Weightman-Rosengarten\\n(PWR), a large fine chemical company based in Phila-\\ndelphia, “…wanted to retire and enjoy life.”  In the words\\nof Adolph Rosengarten, Jr., (8):\\nFather (Adolph senior) liked to shoot grouse in Scot-\\nland in the summer, Uncle Fritz liked to fish any-\\nwhere he could, Uncle George liked to fish for tar-\\npon off the Florida Keys, and Uncle Joe was satis-\\nfied to stay home and play golf because he was stone\\ndeaf.\\nPWR wanted to merge with another chemical company\\nand leave the day-to-day operations to the new partner.\\nFigure 2.  Merck & Co. pharmacy in New York city, 1897.\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n3\\nThey wanted to merge with Pfizer, but the Attorney\\nGeneral determined this merger would violate anti-trust\\nlaws.  Merck was an ideal candidate because, as Adolph,\\nJr. put it, “We were solvent and they weren’t.”  With the\\nmerger in 1927, a new company, Merck and Co., Inc.,\\nwas formed.  The Merck Corporation, the new name\\nadopted by the original firm, and PWR transferred all\\nproperty to the new company, which now had combined\\nassets of about $9 million, and PWR lent $5 to 6 million\\nto the new company.  As part of the merger, Frederick\\nRosengarten became chairman of the board, and Adolph\\nand George became members of the board.  George W.\\nMerck became president of the new company (9).  This\\nwas the first of two major mergers that determined the\\nfuture of Merck.  In each instance the merger signifi-\\ncantly influenced the continued growth and development\\nof the company.\\nPWR was, like Merck, a long-line chemical firm,\\nselling over a thousand products.  The offerings of the\\ntwo companies were sufficiently different that they\\ncomplemented one another.  As a result of the merger\\nthe combined company had a “large enough inventory\\nto carry it through three years of the Depression with-\\nout having to make anything  (10).”\\nThe new company, with sales in 1928 of over $13\\nmillion, could afford to make a heavy investment in re-\\nsearch and development.  After the merger George Merck\\nbrought in his brother-in-law, George W. Perkins, the\\nson of a famous banker, as chief operating officer.\\nPerkins was influential in establishing the new research\\nunit.  Merck and Perkins, with the advice and guidance\\nof Alfred Newton Richards, a noted clinical pharma-\\ncologist at the University of Pennsylvania, went search-\\ning for someone to run the new research operation (11).\\nThey first went to Princeton—Perkins’ alma mater—\\nwhere they found a young organic chemist, Randolph\\nMajor, who was to lead Merck research for the next 26\\nyears.\\nA research unit had actually begun in 1916, prob-\\nably an acknowledgment that chemicals would no longer\\nbe available from Germany.   William Engels had be-\\ncome director of the research laboratories in 1918.  Un-\\ntil 1930 the “research labs” were spread throughout the\\nmanufacturing facility in Rahway, probably because the\\nprimary function of “research” was to service the manu-\\nfacturing end of the company.  In a 1932 memo, Major\\nlisted four main functions of  “research” prior to 1930\\n(12):\\n•  Transformation of laboratory processes\\ninto processes suitable for the factory.\\n•  General improvement of processes.\\n•  Study of methods for keeping and pre-\\nserving materials after they are made.\\n•  Investigation of complaints by customers\\nwhich could not be handled by others.\\nIn 1930 Major set up the Laboratory for\\nPure or Fundamental Research with six\\nchemists and made plans for a new research\\nlaboratory to house this unit.  Engels headed\\nup the Laboratory for Applied Research\\nwith an additional ten chemists.  At the end\\nof his 1932 memo, Major made a point of\\nmentioning papers that had been published\\nin the previous two years and his intention\\nof publishing most of the “results of scien-\\ntific value” from the “laboratory of pure re-\\nsearch.”  This set the tone for Merck re-\\nsearch.  George W. Merck had a vision of a\\nresearch laboratory the equal of any aca-\\ndemic department, and publications from\\nthe new research unit were a step in that\\ndirection.\\nMajor had a knack for choosing pro-\\nductive programs and productive people.\\nFigure 3.

Engles (second from left), Associate\\nDirector, examining an intermediate in the synthesis of pantothenic\\nacid with team of chemists who synthesized it in 1940:  (left to right)\\nKarl Folkers, Assistant Director of Research, J. Finkelstein, J. C.\\nKeresztesy, and E. T. Stiller.\\n4\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nHis most successful early program was to isolate, deter-\\nmine the structures of, and synthesize as many vitamins\\nas possible.  The origin of this program is not clear.  He\\nmay have observed considerable activity in vitamin re-\\nsearch in Europe and little in the US, and/or he may\\nhave foreseen the possibility of enriching foods with\\nvitamins or using pills to treat people with vitamin defi-\\nciencies.  It is difficult to believe that he had any idea of\\njust how profitable this program would become.\\nIn 1934, Merck hired Karl Folkers who had earned\\na Ph.D. with Homer Adkins at Wisconsin and then served\\nas a postdoctoral fellow with Treat B. Johnson at Yale.\\nJohnson instilled in Folkers an interest in compounds\\nwith biological activity.  Folkers made a life’s work—\\nsome say an obsession—of isolating and synthesizing\\nbiologically active molecules.  He was the perfect fit\\nfor Merck’s vitamin program.  Folkers’ description of\\nMajor’s approach to directing his researchers is reveal-\\ning (13):\\nHe was not a man who directed you.  He said, “Here’s\\na problem.  Good luck.”  Then he left you on your\\nown.\\nAfter a few years of Majors’ leadership, Merck, collabo-\\nrating with R.R. Williams at Bell Labs, had done sig-\\nnificant work on thiamine, vitamin B1 (14).  Synthesized\\nin 1936, it soon accounted for over10% of Merck’s sales.\\nIn 1938-39 Folkers and his group isolated and synthe-\\nsized vitamin B6, and in 1940 they reported the synthe-\\nsis of pantothenic acid, another of the B vitamins (Fig.\\n3).\\nIt was one thing to search for biologically active\\nmolecules, determine their structures and synthesize\\nthem.  This was the work of organic chemists.  It was\\nquite another matter to determine whether molecules\\nwere, in fact, biologically active, and once isolated,\\nwhether they would prove useful and safe for the pre-\\nvention or healing of disease.  For this there was a need\\nfor pharmacologists and biologists.  It was difficult to\\nhire first rate pharmacologists in this country because\\nof the stigma attached to working in industry.  Pharma-\\ncologists working in industry were not permitted mem-\\nbership in the American Society of Pharmacology and\\nExperimental Therapeutics; and a member who went to\\nwork in industry was forced to resign from the Society.\\nAlfred Newton Richards, one of the founders of the So-\\nciety, had to resign his membership when he began con-\\nsulting for Merck.  The restriction was eventually with-\\ndrawn and Richards’ membership in the Society was re-\\ninstated.\\nWith the help of Richards, Merck hired Dr. Hans\\nMolitor of Austria in 1932 to head the new Merck Insti-\\ntute of Therapeutic Research.  Molitor expected to re-\\nturn to Vienna within a few years but, in the end, re-\\nmained as head of the Institute until 1956.  The Insti-\\ntute, housed in Rahway and funded by Merck, was an\\nindependent facility because a New Jersey law prevented\\nindustrial companies from conducting animal research.\\nCooperation between the Institute and the Laboratory\\nfor Pure and Fundamental Research was essential for\\nisolating and developing new pharmaceutical products.\\nIn 1933 the three research arms of Merck, the Labora-\\ntory for Pure and Fundamental Research, the Labora-\\ntory for Applied Research, and the Merck Institute of\\nTherapeutic Research, moved into a new building at the\\nRahway facility.\\nIn 1937, Major hired Max Tishler, another even-\\ntual key participant, for his research team.  Tishler (Fig.\\n4) had graduated from Tufts and had taken his Ph.D.\\nunder Elmer Kohler at Harvard (15).  After obtaining\\nhis doctorate, he stayed on at Harvard for another three\\nyears, teaching, doing research, and revising James\\nConant’s textbook (16) (Conant was, by then, president\\nof Harvard).  Tishler, because he was Jewish, had diffi-\\nculty finding an academic or industrial position.  Kohler\\nrecommended Tishler to Major; Conant recommended\\nhim to George Merck, and Max was hired.  Carl Addinall,\\na Merck employee and a former Harvard graduate stu-\\ndent who had been Max’ instructor in Chem 5, also rec-\\nFigure 4.  Max Tishler, circa 1963\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n5\\nommended Max to his supervisor at Merck\\n(17).  Randolph Major, Karl Folkers, and\\nMax Tishler, were to lead Merck’s research\\nand development programs for almost 40\\nyears.\\nTishler’s first job at Merck was to find\\nways to synthesize riboflavin, vitamin B2, to\\nbypass the German process patents.  Within\\ntwo years Merck was manufacturing and\\nmarketing riboflavin.  Folkers was driven to\\nfind new vitamins and exploit their use.\\nTishler was motivated not only to find\\nnew products, but also to follow them all\\nthe way to the customer.  In a 1983 inter-\\nview, he said (18):\\nOne of the greatest thrills I had in ribo-\\nflavin was when the plant was producing the\\nfirst kilogram of stuff.  I was there!  It was a\\ngreat thrill.\\nHe had followed riboflavin from the bench\\nthrough the pilot plant and the factory, get-\\nting involved in every step of the process.\\nTishler was the ultimate process chemist.  He loved\\nto take new compounds from the research bench and\\ndevelop efficient processes for producing the compounds\\non a large scale and interacting with the chemical engi-\\nneers in building a production plant.  He was also en-\\ndowed with enormous energy.  Lew Sarett, in a 1990\\ninterview, said (19):\\nMax was born with an energy level that was like an\\navalanche and a brain that was incandescent.  It was\\nscintillating— the combination of energy and ability\\nwas extraordinary.  I’ve never known a guy like that.\\nNext came World War II and Merck became involved in\\ntwo projects that had an enormous impact on the future\\ndevelopment of the company.  The first project was one\\ninvolving the adrenal corticosteroids.  The isolation and\\nsynthesis of these steroids were a major government\\npriority, and the project was organized as an interna-\\ntional consortium.  At the time Merck signed up to par-\\nticipate in the program, there was no steroid chemist on\\nthe staff.  However, Professor Everett Wallis of\\nPrinceton, a Merck consultant, recommended that Merck\\nhire one of his graduate students, Lewis Sarett (Fig. 5).\\nSarett had only been attending graduate school for 2 1/\\n2 years, but under the circumstances Princeton approved\\nhis leaving with a doctorate.  In January of 1942 Sarett\\nwas sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota to\\nwork with E. C. Kendall, one of the world’s experts on\\nthese hormones (20).  His mission was to find out how\\nMerck could be of help.  By 1944,  Sarett had prepared\\n18 mg of the first synthetic cortisone (21, 22).  Sarett\\nwould go on to lead Merck’s fundamental research ef-\\nforts and eventually succeed Tishler as president of\\nMerck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories\\n(MSDRL).\\nThe development group, under Tishler’s direction,\\nsupplied Sarett with large batches of intermediates as\\nhe worked toward the final synthesis.  They were gear-\\ning up to produce large amounts of cortisone in case it\\nproved to be useful.  It turned out not to have any war\\ntime use, but Merck process chemists eventually pro-\\nduced about a kilo of cortisone for testing.  This was\\nfortunate for Merck, the medical community, and the\\npublic, because, in 1948, Philip Hench at the Mayo\\nClinic, using Merck produced material, discovered that\\ncortisone was an effective anti-inflammatory agent that\\ncould be used to alleviate the severe symptoms of rheu-\\nmatoid arthritis.  Tishler reported that Hench did not\\ndiscover the value of cortisone until he had used about\\n100 g of Merck product (23).  If Merck had made only\\n25 g of material, the Golden Age of Steroid Chemistry,\\nthe late 1940s and the 1950s, might have been set back\\nseveral years.  Hench and Kendall, along with Tadeus\\nReichstein, shared the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology\\nor Medicine for their work on cortisone.  One of the\\nmany beneficiaries of cortisone was the painter Raoul\\nDufy whose arthritic condition had essentially ended his\\nFigure 5.  Lewis Sarett (left) with Edward C. Kendall and George\\nW. Merck (seated) in 1950 in Sarett’s Rahway laboratory.\\n6\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\ncareer.  Cortisone restored his ability to paint, and as a\\ngesture of gratitude he gave Merck the reproduction\\nrights to five of his paintings.   Merck was then in a\\nposition to begin manufacturing cortisone.  Under\\nTishler’s leadership the development group, starting\\nfrom desoxycholic acid, reduced the number of synthetic\\nsteps from over 40 down to 26; and they improved the\\nyields sufficiently to make synthetic cortisone economi-\\ncally viable (24).  The Merck process was so efficient\\nthat it continued to be economically competitive even\\nafter Upjohn discovered the biological oxidation of C-\\n11 that significantly reduced the complexity of the cor-\\ntisone synthesis (25).\\nThe other major wartime project was penicillin.\\nMerck again volunteered to become involved in the gov-\\nernment program even though the company had little\\nexperience in fermentation.  Merck scientists initially\\nthought they could synthesize penicillin, as opposed to\\nisolating it from a fermentation broth, but as one Merck\\nchemist put it, “this was not the right horse to bet on.”\\nWhen early attempts at the preparation of penicillin by\\nfermentation went badly, Merck again turned to an out-\\nside consultant, Selman Waksman from Rutgers (Fig.\\n6).  Waksman sent one of his graduate students, Boyd\\nWoodruff, to Merck to observe and help solve the fer-\\nmentation problems.  The difficulties were eventually\\nsolved and Merck\\nbecame a contribu-\\ntor of penicillin dur-\\ning the war.    Com-\\npared to Pfizer and\\nSquibb, Merck was\\nnot a big producer of\\npenicillin immedi-\\nately after the war,\\nbut eventually the\\ncompany became\\none of the largest\\nmanufacturers of\\npenicillin.  Fermen-\\ntation became very\\nimportant for Merck\\nand has been used\\nfor the production of\\na number of major\\nMerck products,\\namong them strepto-\\nmycin, cefoxitin,\\nivermectin, \\nand\\nlovastatin.\\nAfter World War II Merck planned to build a plant\\nat its Stonewall facility in Elkton, Virginia for the pro-\\nduction of streptothricin, an antibiotic discovered by\\nWaksman and Woodruff, which was effective against\\nbacteria where penicillin failed.  However, before con-\\nstruction began, they found that streptothricin was highly\\ntoxic.  Fortunately, within a few months Waksman and\\nhis students discovered streptomycin, which exhibited\\nthe same antibacterial spectrum as streptothricin but was\\nnot toxic.  Streptomycin turned out to be effective against\\ntuberculosis; and Merck, at the request of Waksman,\\nturned its exclusive patent rights to streptomycin over\\nto a Rutgers foundation for licensing to all the pharma-\\nceutical houses.  This magnanimous act was partly in\\nthe interests of public health and partly in the long-term\\ninterests of Merck in maintaining productive relation-\\nships with foundation and academic research (26, 27).\\nIn the early 1940s Karl Folkers and his group be-\\ngan searching for the anti-pernicious anemia factor\\npresent in liver extracts (28). The Merck group was not\\nalone; Glaxo and Lederle were also working on the prob-\\nlem.  The relatively small number of patients suffering\\nfrom this debilitating disease could only survive by con-\\nsuming large amounts of liver on a daily basis.  Obvi-\\nously there was something in the liver that was impor-\\ntant, but isolating the factor seemed nearly impossible.\\nAlthough \\none\\ncould obtain liver\\nextracts and di-\\nvide them into\\nfractions, the only\\nassay available\\nrequired a patient\\nwho was suffering\\nfrom the disease.\\nTo find a patient\\nand follow the ef-\\nfect of feeding a\\nspecific liver frac-\\ntion was a slow,\\nfrustrating pro-\\ncess.  With luck\\nand a prepared\\nmind, Folkers lo-\\ncated a researcher\\nat the University\\nof \\nMaryland,\\nMary Shorb, who\\nhad discovered a\\nsimple biological\\nFigure 6.  Selman W. Waksman (left), Randolph T. Major, and Alexander\\nFleming, the discoverer of penicillin, circa 1948.   Fleming shared the 1945\\nNobel Prize in Medicine with Chain and Florey for their work on\\npenicillin.  Waksman won the 1952 Nobel Prize for his work on antibiotics.\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n7\\nassay that responded to liver extracts.  Merck microbi-\\nologists soon found Shorb’s assay was specific for the\\nanti-pernicious anemia factor, vitamin B12.  At about the\\nsame time Merck researchers discovered that the strep-\\ntomycin broth, the waste from the production of strep-\\ntomycin, contained vitamin B12.  Using this new source\\nof B12 and the new assay, B12 was isolated in a short\\nperiod of time, just ahead of the isolation by Glaxo and\\nLederle.  Vitamin B12 turned out to be a red compound,\\nbut the color is only discernible at high concentration.\\nOnce it is sufficiently concentrated, the color can be used\\nas a guide in its isolation.  Just months before B12 was\\nisolated, the company had decided to drop the project\\nbecause too much time and too many resources had been\\nexpended in this search for the cure for a relatively mi-\\nnor disease.  But Major and Folkers, realizing how close\\nthey were to success, quietly carried on the quest (29).\\nAfter all this effort Merck had isolated the anti-per-\\nnicious anemia factor:  a scientific achievement, but\\nhardly one to provide much income for the company.\\nThen they discovered that B12 was, in the words of Karl\\nFolkers (30):\\nthe growth factor for animals, and that meant that\\nMerck would have a profit deluxe in contrast to a\\nvitamin for a rare disease.\\nAfter World War II Merck rapidly expanded into a num-\\nber of foreign markets, taking up some of the void left\\nby the decimation of the European chemical and phar-\\nmaceutical houses.  By the early 1950s exports consti-\\ntuted about 20% of Merck’s sales, which had soared from\\n$24 million in 1940 to $171 million in 1951 (5); but\\nMerck was still selling chemicals in traditional industry\\nstyle.  It produced chemicals and pharmaceuticals and\\nsold them in bulk to others for packaging,\\ndistribution,and sales to the consumer.  Some of Merck’s\\nbiggest customers, the pharmaceutical houses, were now\\nproducing their own products.  If Merck were to retain a\\nsignificant market share, its newest products, penicil-\\nlin, streptomycin, and cortisone seemed to call for a dif-\\nferent approach, one where a sales force would contact\\nphysicians directly (31).\\nMerck could not effect this change easily on its own,\\nbut a merger with Sharp and Dohme seemed to be an\\nideal solution for both companies.  Sharp and Dohme\\nwas a Philadelphia firm with research, pharmaceutical\\nmanufacturing, packaging, and marketing skills.  With\\nno chemical manufacturing facilities of its own, how-\\never, it had, in fact, been a major Merck customer.  Merck\\nbrought a world class research unit and an extensive\\nchemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing organiza-\\ntion to the merger.  Combining the two companies—\\nparticularly the research units—caused some pain, but\\nresulted in a far stronger company.  The merger was\\neased somewhat by the fact that the president of Sharp\\n& Dohme, William Dempsey, and the chairman of its\\nboard, John Zinnser, had previously worked for Merck.\\nTwo scientists helped enormously in the success of\\nthe merger, as far as Merck Sharp & Dohme Research\\nLaboratories (MSDRL) was concerned.  One was Max\\nTishler, who was appointed president of MSDRL in\\n1956, a post he was to hold until 1969.  The other was\\nKarl Beyer, who was employed at Sharp & Dohme in\\nthe West Point laboratories outside Philadelphia. An MD\\nwhose specialty was medical physiology and pharma-\\ncology, Beyer felt his major goal in life was to find and\\nproduce therapeutic substances.  As a “biological Max\\nTishler” he fit beautifully into the new system.  Had it\\nnot been for the merger, Beyer would have resigned from\\nSharp and Dohme because it had no development chem-\\nistry or chemical manufacturing facilities (32).\\nWithin a few years of the merger, Beyer and James\\nSprague, a former Wisconsin student of Homer Adkins\\nwho had followed Karl Folkers to Yale and Treat\\nJohnson’s Laboratory and who was the head of Medici-\\nnal Chemistry at West Point, produced chlorothiazide\\n(Diuril). As the first major diuretic, its sales exceeded\\nall expectations.  This was Merck’s entry into the area\\nof hypertension, and it was done with enormous suc-\\ncess (33, 34).\\nIn 1950, a few years before the 1953 merger, George\\nW. Merck, who had been president of Merck from 1925,\\ngave over the presidency to James Kerrigan.  George\\nW. Merck remained as Chairman of the Board until his\\ndeath in November 1957.  Kerrigan, who had worked\\nfor the senior George Merck as a teenager, eventually\\nserved George W. Merck as vice president for sales and\\nlater commercial vice president before he was appointed\\npresident.  His tenure as president, from 1950 to 1955,\\nincluded the merger with Sharp & Dohme and the ex-\\npansion of global operations; but Kerrigan was not the\\nperson to guide Merck through all the problems of the\\nmerger.  So, in 1955, John (Jack) Connor, who had been\\ngeneral counsel and secretary of Merck, was appointed\\nPresident and CEO, positions he held until 1965 when\\nhe became Secretary of Commerce under Lyndon\\nJohnson.  Connor led Merck through the consolidation\\nwith Sharp & Dohme, the enormous expansion of inter-\\nnational operations (MSDI) and through some serious\\nattacks by the Federal Trade Commission and Senator\\nKefauver (35).\\n8\\nBull.

Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nPfizer Inc. celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1999.  I\\nwill attempt to present a thumbnail sketch of the history\\nof this company and of how it became the global phar-\\nmaceutical giant it is today.  My special emphasis will\\nbe on the Central Research Division and the key role it\\nplayed in the history of Pfizer Inc.\\nTwo cousins, Charles\\nErhart, a confectioner, and\\nCharles Pfizer, a chemist,\\nwere both in their mid-twen-\\nties when they came to the\\nUnited States from Germany\\nin 1849.  They were the first\\nof the innovative entrepre-\\nneurs that later came to be the\\nstandard for employees of\\nPfizer Inc.  With $2,500 of\\ntheir own money and a $1,000\\nmortgage, they set up shop in\\na two-story brick building on\\nBartlett Street in Brooklyn,\\nNew York.  Initially, they sold\\nhigh quality chemicals like\\nsantonin, a major treatment\\nfor intestinal worms that was\\na prevalent human disease in\\nthose days.  Pfizer, the chemist, prepared this high-qual-\\nity chemical and Erhart, the confectioner, flavored it to\\nmake it more palatable.  Through their combined ef-\\nforts it became a very successful product for the little\\ncompany.  This represented the first team effort at\\nPfizer—a technique that would be utilized extensively\\nin the coming years.  Within ten years the cousins were\\nimporting chemicals like mercurials, camphor, boric\\nacid, tartaric acid, and citric acid extracted from lem-\\nons.  They provided cream of tartar, iodine, and mor-\\nphine during the Civil War, and their business grew rap-\\nidly.  By 1865 they achieved $1.4 million in sales and\\nemployed 150 workers.\\nThrough the late\\n1800s and early 1900s\\nPfizer Inc. expanded\\nsteadily but with no big\\nspurts in growth.  From\\n1917 to 1929 James\\nCurrie, Pfizer’s first re-\\nsearch chemist, devel-\\noped a process for pro-\\nducing citric acid by fer-\\nmentation of sugar.\\nCurrie came from the De-\\npartment of Agriculture,\\nwhere he was trying to\\nproduce an American\\nbrand of Roquefort\\ncheese by fermentation.\\nHe was not successful.\\nHe then tried to ferment\\nsugar to produce oxalic acid but again failed.  However,\\nhe noticed an interesting byproduct in this fermentation:\\ncitric acid.  Currie contacted Pfizer, related his finding,\\nwas hired, and, with his assistant Jasper Kane, eventu-\\nally developed a large-scale fermentation process for\\ncitric acid.  This process, called SUCIAC (sugar to cit-\\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF PFIZER\\nCENTRAL RESEARCH*\\nJoseph G. Lombardino\\nCharles Erhart\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n11\\nric acid conversion), was developed in response to the\\nshort supply of citric acid because of the high cost and\\nvariable supply of lemons from abroad.  The fermenta-\\ntion process for citric acid was never patented, but it\\nwas kept a company secret.\\nIn 1923 Jasper Kane made a major breakthrough in\\nthe citric acid fermentation process.  He found a way to\\nuse molasses as a substrate, instead of the more expen-\\nsive refined sugar.  By 1929, through Pfizer’s use of the\\nnew process, lemons were no longer needed for making\\ncitric acid;  and citric acid production at Pfizer, all via\\nfermentation, totaled 10 million pounds, with the prod-\\nuct taking over almost the whole market at that time.\\nIn addition to citric acid, another major fermenta-\\ntion success for Pfizer involved the production of peni-\\ncillin on a commercial scale.  The story of Alexander\\nFleming and his accidental discovery of penicillin in\\n1927 is a familiar one.  Fleming’s discovery might have\\nremained a laboratory curiosity if a practical, large-scale\\nproduction method had not been found.  World War II\\nincreased the urgency for producing penicillin in quan-\\ntity, but large-scale penicillin production could not be\\ndeveloped in war ravaged England.  So Pfizer, in 1941,\\nwas asked by the US and British governments to ac-\\ncomplish large-scale penicillin production by means of\\ndeep tank fermentation.  Merck, Lederle, and Squibb\\nwere also asked to join in this effort, with all the com-\\npanies required to share their findings.\\nInitially, Pfizer used shallow trays for the fermen-\\ntation process, producing just 24 milligrams (40,000\\nOxford Units) of penicillin in 1943.  Then Pfizer made\\na risky decision to commit $ 3 million for a deep-tank\\nfermentation plant, which opened in a converted ice plant\\nin March, 1944.  By switching to a new penicillin mold\\n(derived from cantaloupes) and using corn steep liquor\\nin the broth, Pfizer scientists increased yields of peni-\\ncillin from the deep-tank process dramatically.\\nBy 1944 Pfizer was a world leader in producing\\npenicillin by fermentation, actually supplying 90% of\\nthe penicillin to US troops who landed on D-Day, June\\n6, in France.  For this effort Pfizer earned the “E” award\\nfor excellence in war production.  By December, 1944\\nPfizer was producing 125 billion Oxford Units of peni-\\ncillin, with all of Pfizer’s technology being shared with\\nthe other companies in the penicillin effort.  Conse-\\nquently, so much penicillin was produced that prices fell\\nfrom 20 dollars to 20 cents per 100,000 Units.  Penicil-\\nlin, which saved so many lives in World War II, was not\\nsold under a Pfizer label.  Later, Pfizer produced strep-\\ntomycin from fermentation with cultures supplied by\\nSelmen Waksman.  The scaled-up process eventually\\nproduced 3200 kilograms per month of this important\\nantibiotic.\\nAt about this time, a soil sample screening program\\nwas established at Pfizer to search for even more potent\\nantibiotics.  This led to the discovery of a new class of\\nantibiotics, the tetracyclines, in the Lederle laboratories\\nin 1948.  By 1950, the structures  of the tetracyclines\\nwere elucidated by a Pfizer research team working with\\nR. B. Woodward of Harvard.  Meanwhile, Pfizer research\\nuncovered PA-76, (Pfizer antibiotic, 76th  sample), later\\nnamed Terramycin, from soil samples.  This agent was\\neffective against 100 infectious organisms.  Pfizer Inc.\\nhad total sales of $60 million in 1950, the year this fer-\\nmentation product was approved by the FDA in less than\\nsix months.  Then a key decision was made.  Pfizer Presi-\\ndent, John Smith, told his successor, John McKeen,  (who\\nhad joined Pfizer in 1926 and later rose to become the\\ncompany’s Chief Executive Officer), “Let’s sell\\nTerramycin ourselves; go into the pharmaceutical busi-\\nness if we have to.”  That was a critical decision and a\\nbig risk, since Pfizer would be venturing into unknown\\nterritory and would also anger the major wholesaler cus-\\ntomers who were previously sellers of all Pfizer prod-\\nucts.  The decision, however, was a financial success.\\nSales of Terramycin, the first pharmaceutical with\\nPfizer’s name on the bottle, rose to $45 million in just\\ntwo years and accounted for 42% of company revenues.\\nAt that time, 55 Pfizer salesmen were selling the new\\nantibiotic.\\nCharles Pfizer\\n12\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nTogether with Wilber Lazier, Karl Brunnings hired\\nthe 1950s group of Pfizer scientists who were the next\\ngeneration of innovators for the company.  A new group\\nof chemists joined Pfizer’s research team in the early\\n1950s, some of whom later went on to hold key posi-\\ntions in the company.  They began their careers, as did\\nthe present author, in 1957, working in a small labora-\\ntory in Brooklyn, New York.  Among these chemists\\nwas Gerald Laubach, a chemist who came from M.I.T.\\nand headed the synthetic medicinal section of Pfizer’s\\nresearch.  Later he was to become president of Pfizer\\nInc.  William McLamore was a chemist from Harvard\\nUniversity who later became the inventor of several\\nPfizer drugs, including Diabinese.  Robert Feeney, from\\nYale University, played a critical role in establishing a\\nlicensing department for obtaining products like\\nProcardia XL from external sources.  Lloyd Conover\\ncame to Pfizer from the University of Rochester. He\\nplayed a critical role in the synthesis of Tetracycline and\\nlater headed up the Sandwich, U.K. research site and\\nthen Pfizer’s animal health research.  Rex Pinson, also\\nfrom the University of Rochester, rose to become head\\nof Medicinal Research.  Barry Bloom, a chemist from\\nM.I.T., was named President of Pfizer Central Research\\nwhen it became a separate global division in 1971.  Even-\\ntually he was Pfizer’s Corporate Vice-President for R &\\nD.\\nBy 1953 the Pfizer sales force had grown to 1300,\\nand company sales in that year had risen to $127 mil-\\nlion dollars.  Lloyd Conover succeeded in the chemical\\nmodification of chlortetracycline to produce the antibi-\\notic Tetracyn, which was marketed in 1954.  Now, with\\ntwo major antibiotics to sell, McKeen opted to expand\\nPfizer’s operations and sales into Europe, a risky deci-\\nsion for a small US-based company.  But John McKeen\\nhad the vision to see the importance of markets outside\\nthe US.  In 1957 the company opened a research labora-\\ntory in Sandwich, England with 6 scientists on staff.  This\\nsmall laboratory has grown today to fill a very large\\nresearch site in Sandwich and contributed some of\\nPfizer’s major modern pharmaceuticals, such as Norvasc\\nand Viagra.\\nIn 1958 Pfizer launched Diabinese for treating dia-\\nbetes; this drug was the first non-antibiotic, small mol-\\necule pharmaceutical from Pfizer.  The long plasma half-\\nlife and convenient dosing regimen made this sulfony-\\nlurea a commercial success.  In 1960, research opera-\\ntions in the US were consolidated in Groton, Connecti-\\ncut.  On 19 acres of land already owned by the company\\nacross the street from the fermentation manufacturing\\nplant, a new research facility was built in order to con-\\nsolidate the various R&D departments.  Having all the\\nkey scientific disciplines on one site was correctly\\nviewed as vital to facilitating communications and thus\\nmaking drug R&D more efficient.\\nThere were other important changes occurring.  At\\nthat time the synthetic organic chemistry camp was vy-\\ning with the microbiologist fermentation chemists to gain\\ncontrol of the future direction for research.  Would the\\nPfizer Company remain a fermentation-based company\\nor not?  Would synthetic organic chemistry produce the\\nPfizer drugs of the future?  The outcome of these ques-\\ntions would not be settled for several years.\\nIn 1960 John McKeen set the seemingly impossible\\ngoal of $500 million in sales by 1965 (“5X5”). As an\\nemployee, I remember how wildly impossible this goal\\nseemed, but it was achieved.  That same year, Pfizer\\nheadquarters moved from Brooklyn to a new skyscraper\\nin midtown Manhattan at 42nd Street and 2nd Avenue.\\nUnder the leadership of Gerald Laubach, Vice-\\nPresident for Medicinal Products, a revamped research\\norganization became more productive through system-\\natic, well-planned, and scientifically managed R&D pro-\\ncedures.  The organization adopted a philosophy of mis-\\nsion oriented research.  Laubach required specific goals\\nfor the science being done, and he emphasized the ra-\\ntionally designed organic chemical as a source for fu-\\nture medicines.  This move also coincided with the be-\\nginning of the first move to utilize informal\\nmultidisciplinary teams assigned to specific projects.\\nOver time, synthesis of small organic chemicals as po-\\ntential drugs became the accepted philosophy for re-\\nsearch, and fermentation-based research decreased sig-\\nnificantly.\\nIn the decade of the 1960s, the Kefauver-Harris\\nAmendments dramatically increased the cost, time, and\\ndifficulty of developing new pharmaceuticals.  Pfizer\\nInc., concerned about its future as a pharmaceutical com-\\npany, responded by diversifying into almost 30\\nnonpharmaceutical businesses.  These included buying\\nBarbasol shave cream, Desitin ointment for diaper rash,\\nPacquin hand cream and Coty cosmetics.  Pharmaceuti-\\ncal research was continuing at Pfizer, however, with\\nsome successes during that period.  Products developed\\nduring the 1960s and 1970s included Renese, a diuretic,\\nthe Sabin polio oral vaccine, which Pfizer produced on\\na commercial scale, Vibramycin, an antibiotic, Navane,\\nan antipsychotic, and Sinequan, for depression.\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n13\\nIn 1971 Central Research was formed as a sepa-\\nrate, worldwide organization with centralized manage-\\nment out of Groton, Connecticut.  This reorganization\\nfurther improved the efficiency of Pfizer’s R&D, al-\\nthough the R&D budget was still quite small compared\\nto that of competitors, only about 5% of corporate sales.\\nGroton was a small site with only a few chemists, bi-\\nologists, metabolism chemists, and clinicians among the\\nfew hundred employees, a laboratory for bulk chemical\\nmaterials, and a library. Barry Bloom was chosen to head\\nthe centralized management of Pfizer Research world-\\nwide, while Sandwich was reorganized under the lead-\\nership of Lloyd Conover.  New research management in\\nGroton set focused goals, coordinated all projects, and\\nheld regular reviews of the growing R&D portfolio by a\\nsingle group of research managers.  The company expe-\\nrienced significant growth in sales in the 1970s from\\nunder $1 billion to almost $3 billion, but with almost\\nflat R&D budgets and staffing.  There was still concern\\namong some Pfizer Corporate leaders about the wisdom\\nof becoming mainly a pharmaceutical company and\\nabout investing too heavily in R&D.  There were also\\nsome disappointments within R&D, such as failure of\\npotential major products at late stages of development.\\nThese included Tolamolol, an antihypertensive, and\\nTibric Acid, a cholesterol-lowering agent. A successful\\nantihypertensive agent, Minipress (Prazosin), was\\nlaunched in 1976, however.  Despite these relatively lean\\nyears of research productivity, Jack Powers, Chief Ex-\\necutive Officer from 1965 to 1972, strongly supported\\ninvesting in R&D, even when corporate funds were lim-\\nited.  He recognized that Pfizer needed to support re-\\nsearch as an investment for the future.  Powers retired\\nin 1972, appointing Gerald Laubach as President and\\nEdward Pratt as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman\\nof Pfizer Inc.\\nPfizer’s major product in the 1980s was Feldene, a\\ndrug for arthritis. The company’s entry into arthritis re-\\nsearch began in the 1960s with a team of two individu-\\nals, Ted Wiseman and the present author.  Before suc-\\ncess was achieved, a five-year research project was\\nneeded to identify an appropriate drug candidate, and\\nthen more than a decade to do extensive clinical trials\\nand to select the best of the newly discovered oxicams\\nand to secure its approval.  The length of this project\\nderived mainly from our determination not to follow the\\nexisting structural leads, then mainly carboxylic acids.\\nOur goals raised the hurdles for the project, but in the\\nend afforded a superior product from a medical and com-\\nmercial point of view.  The Feldene project was started\\nin 1962 and concluded in 1982 with the US launch of\\nthe product—a 20-year period, about half the span of\\nmy career.   It is not unusual for a project to require this\\nlength of time.  For example, the project to produce\\nDiflucan, a major antifungal agent from Pfizer, also took\\n20 years from the start in 1970 to the launch in 1990.\\nFeldene became Pfizer’s largest selling drug product at\\nthe time, with peak annual sales of up to $700 million\\nby the late 1980s.  This contributed significantly to cor-\\nporate sales which more than doubled from $2.5 to $5.7\\nbillion.  The success of Feldene apparently convinced\\nPfizer’s leaders that pharmaceutical research had a fu-\\nture and could lead to very successful commercial prod-\\nucts.\\nEd Pratt, Chief Executive Officer from 1972 to\\n1992, was a strong supporter of R&D during this pe-\\nriod.  He recognized the need to raise the R&D budget\\nfrom the $50-million level (5% of sales) when he be-\\ncame CEO in 1972 to the 15-20% of sales needed to\\nmake the research organization a strong force and to\\nbuild for the future.  This daring investment in the 1970s\\ntransformed Central Research and laid the groundwork\\nfor Pfizer to become a productive research organization\\nin the 1980s and 1990s.  Feldene’s clinical studies, the\\nZithromax project, and the Norvasc and Diflucan\\nprojects had their origins in the 1970s. Increasing R&D\\ninvestment was a risky decision at a time when the phar-\\nmaceutical industry was under great pressure from the\\nregulators.  Eventually, Pratt spent a total of $6 billion\\non Pfizer’s R&D during his tenure.  As company annual\\nrevenues grew from over $1 billion in the 1970s to $7\\nbillion in the 1990s, R&D funding increased from $8\\nmillion in 1971 to $179 million in 1981 and then to $757\\nmillion in 1991.\\nThe growth of Central Research at all its world-\\nwide sites created its own set of challenges, since in-\\ncreasing size brought increasing managerial problems.\\nHow does one manage such a large complex worldwide\\norganization?  Communications became more challeng-\\ning; keeping the larger organization focused on the ma-\\njor goals became a problem.  One solution involved for-\\nmation of a senior management committee, the brain\\nchild of Walter Moreland and John Niblack, with the\\nsupport of Barry Bloom.  In this system both discovery\\nand development are highly focused, goal-oriented, and\\nmanaged by teams of scientists who report to a small\\ngroup of senior managers.  In the discovery phase, each\\nresearch project has an operating plan with clearly de-\\nfined goals, timelines, and milestones.  The plan for the\\nproject is endorsed by management and reviewed regu-\\n14\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nlarly.  The latest technology is employed in order to make\\ndiscovery efforts as efficient as possible.  In the drug\\ndevelopment phase, a similar group of senior managers\\nfrom key departments regularly reviews the status, plans,\\nand problems of each of the development projects.  This\\nmanagement group hears the recommendations of the\\nproject teams and then makes the decisions on large\\nexpenditures, project\\nterminations, \\nand\\nprioritization \\nof\\nprojects.\\nIn \\n1986 \\nthe\\npresent author helped\\nto organize a project\\nmanagement group in\\nCentral Research and to\\nestablish the matrix\\nteam system.  This was\\nnot an easy change in\\nPfizer’s culture, but\\neventually the team en-\\nvironment for develop-\\ning drugs gained accep-\\ntance.  The Early Can-\\ndidate Management\\nTeams (ECMTs), led by\\nscientists, manage a\\ndrug \\ndevelopment\\nproject up to the start of\\nPhase 3 clinical trials.\\nThe teams are made up\\nof about 8 members\\nfrom the key technical\\ndisciplines involved in\\nthe \\ndevelopment\\nproject.  These teams\\ngenerate the pre-IND\\ndata and carry out\\nPhases 1 and 2 in the\\nclinic.  Later, cross-di-\\nvisional Global Devel-\\nopment Teams (GDTs) plan and govern Phase 3 trials\\nneeded for NDA filing.\\nThe productivity of Pfizer’s own research and its\\nlicensing efforts increased dramatically in the 1980s and\\n1990s.  Modern products launched by Pfizer in this pe-\\nriod include:  Feldene, an antiarthritic; Procardia XL,\\nan antihypertensive; Unasyn, an injectable antibiotic;\\nZoloft, an antidepressant; Zithromax, an antibiotic;\\nZyrtec, for treating allergies; Norvasc, an antihyperten-\\nsive; Diflucan, an antifungal agent; Lipitor, a choles-\\nterol-lowering agent; Aricept, a drug for Alzheimer’s\\nDisease; Trovan, an antibiotic;  Viagra, for erectile dys-\\nfunction; and Celebrex for arthiritis.  During this same\\nperiod two major potential agents failed in the develop-\\nment stage:  Sorbinil was lost in Phase 3 because of a\\nrash problem, and tenidap was withdrawn after filing\\nbecause of a perceived ef-\\nfect on bone density.  Such\\nis the risky nature of phar-\\nmaceutical research.  Tens\\nof thousands of compounds\\nare synthesized, and mil-\\nlions of tests are run annu-\\nally, ultimately to bring 12\\nto 18 compounds into de-\\nvelopment, from which one\\nproduct per year is likely to\\nreach the marketplace.\\nToday the current lead-\\ners of Pfizer’s R&D are\\nGeorge Milne as Central\\nResearch President and\\nJohn Niblack as Vice-\\nChairman, Pfizer Inc.  They\\nare setting a new direction\\nfor Pfizer in the modern age\\nof pharmaceutical research\\nthat will carry the firm into\\nthe 21st century.   Major ex-\\npansions are underway at\\nPfizer research sites world-\\nwide.  A total of more than\\none million square feet of\\nR&D laboratory space is\\nbeing added to these global\\nresearch sites.  Under the\\ncurrent Chief Executive Of-\\nficer, William Steere, R&D\\nannual investment has\\ngrown to over $2 billion.\\nThe corporation has sold the divisions that no longer fit\\ninto the core health care businesses:  for example, the\\nminerals operation, the Coty cosmetics business, and\\nthe Food Science group.\\nSo the corporation has expanded dramatically in\\nalmost five decades.  As the R&D budget has grown to\\nover $2 billion, the R&D staff has increased to over 6,000\\npeople worldwide.  The acceleration in growth of the\\nstaff and in funding for R&D during the 1980s was made\\nPfizer’s 42nd Street, NYC, World\\nHeadquarters Building\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n15\\npossible by Feldene sales.  Later, sales of other suc-\\ncessful products permitted even faster growth in R&D\\nin the 1990s.  As a result of past R&D successes, Pfizer\\ncurrently has strong corporate sales from major, impor-\\ntant pharmaceuticals that will be under patent until be-\\nyond 2004-2006.  In addition, a strong pipeline of fu-\\nture new products at various stages of development and\\nsignificant growth in R&D, both in facilities and people,\\ncombine to make Pfizer Central Research a major force\\nand a critical factor in the future success of the com-\\npany.  The innovative, entrepreneurial spirit initiated\\nby the team of two cousins in 1849 has led to a giant\\norganization with almost 50,000 individuals working\\nin teams on five continents, a company where innova-\\ntion and entrepreneurship are the lifeblood for the fu-\\nture.\\nThe author’s view of all this, from over 40 years of\\nobserving the growth of Pfizer Central Research and\\nthe parent company, Pfizer Inc., is that the success is\\ndue to the efforts of thousands of dedicated employees\\nled by a relatively few visionary leaders.  Their com-\\nbined efforts brought us to where we are today and will\\nlead us into a bright future.\\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\\n*Presented at a symposium on the History of US Phar-\\nmaceutical Companies, 216th ACS National Meeting,\\nBoston, MA, August, 1998, HIST 012.\\n1.\\nO.

Slater\\nThe history of SmithKline Beecham is a wonderful ex-\\nample of the American success story:  humble begin-\\nnings; hard work; a good reputation; growth; mergers;\\nmodest success; disappoint-\\nments; breakthroughs; and\\nultimately, great success!\\nBut its previous successes\\nhave not made this company\\ncomplacent, for today it is\\nalso an excellent model of an\\nevolving, global pharmaceu-\\ntical company.\\nThis paper will cover\\nmany aspects of SmithKline,\\nbut the focus will be on the\\ndevelopment of four prod-\\nucts: \\n \\n“Benzedrine,”\\n“Thorazine” (chlorprom-\\nazine), “Dyazide” (a combi-\\nnation of triamterene and hy-\\ndrochlorothiazide), and\\n“Tagamet” (cimetidine).\\nThese successes demon-\\nstrate the importance of re-\\nsearch, as well as of market-\\ning, but they also underline\\nthe importance of good\\npeople who are dedicated to\\ntheir work and to the betterment of society.  This story\\nof a business is fundamentally a human story.\\nIn the Beginning\\nAlthough the Research Division was established in 1925,\\nwe must begin our story in 1830, when John K. Smith\\nfounded a small apothecary\\nshop on North Second\\nStreet in Philadelphia.  His\\nbrother, George, joined him\\nin 1841, and they formed\\nJohn K. Smith & Co.  The\\nbusiness grew and soon had\\na reputation for fine, pure\\nproducts and became a lead-\\ning drug wholesaler.  Four\\nyears later, when John\\nSmith died, George contin-\\nued to build the company’s\\nreputation.  He was known\\nfor catering to the exact re-\\nquirements of physicians,\\nand for using methods that\\nwere quite advanced for his\\ntime.  George took orders\\nfrom as far away as central\\nPennsylvania and New Jer-\\nsey.  It was not unusual for\\nother dealers to make semi-\\nannual visits to his store to\\nplace orders that would last for six months.  By 1855,\\nGeorge Smith had not only expanded his store but had\\nopened a second shop at 149 North Third Street.\\nEmployees at the Cherry Street laboratory of Smith, Kline\\n& Company in Philadelphia.  Although the company was\\nfounded as a wholesale-retail business, in the 1880s it\\nfounded a small manufacturing laboratory to produce a few\\nstaple products. Photo courtesy SmithKline Beecham.\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n17\\nIn 1865, Mahlon N. Kline, an ambitious young\\nbookkeeper, joined the business. Together they contin-\\nued to emphasize the purity of their manufactured prod-\\nucts, with guaranteed quality.  Kline soon sought a\\ngreater challenge and moved into sales, where he gained\\nmany new accounts.  He also began to attend the Phila-\\ndelphia College of Pharmacy, so that he would under-\\nstand more of the business.  A decade later he became a\\npartner, and the company was renamed Smith, Kline &\\nCompany.\\nFrench Richards & Co., another well-established\\nPhiladelphia wholesaler, was absorbed by Smith, Kline\\n& Co. in 1891, and the new company was named Smith,\\nKline and French.  In due course, SK&F became\\nPhiladelphia’s leading drug house, with hundreds of\\nproducts—from tonics to medicines and liniments to\\nperfumes.  Furthermore, SK&F had established a phar-\\nmaceutical \\nlaboratory, \\nwhere \\n“Eskay’s\\nNeurophosphates” were developed, products which\\nhelped to facilitate the company’s rapid growth.  In 1893,\\nSK&F instituted even stricter standards of quality and\\npurity for its growing group of products, emphasizing\\nits concern for providing exceptional quality to its cus-\\ntomers. By the end of the nineteenth century, SK&F had\\nexpanded not only to a six-story building on Arch Street,\\nbut also into two adjoining buildings.\\nA Focus on R&D\\nAn important turning point came in 1925, when the\\nResearch Division of SK&F was established with the\\nhiring of Dr. Fred P. Nabenhauer, an organic chemist.\\n(He was the second person hired to conduct research,\\nultimately retiring in 1955.  The first chemist, Dr. Will-\\niam L. Long, left the company to attend medical school,\\nbut later returned to serve for many years as Director of\\nthe Research and Development Division.  He was one\\nof the guiding lights in the advancement of research at\\nSK&F.)  Thus began the company’s focus on research\\nand development.  In 1926 the first product from or-\\nganic chemical research was “Oxo-ate B” (calcium o-\\niodoxybenzoate), designed to relieve swelling and\\nmuscle spasms in arthritis and rheumatism.  This was\\nfollowed in 1929 by “Benzedrine,” an amphetamine de-\\nsigned to alleviate the symptoms of nasal congestion,\\nhay fever, colds, and other upper respiratory conditions.\\nSK&F, led by Dr. Nabenhauer and later joined by\\nDr. George Connit, was conducting research on amphet-\\namines at the same time as a California chemist, Dr.\\nGordon A. Alles.  Dr. Alles believed that amphetamines\\nwould make a good synthetic substitute for ephedrine,\\nwhich had previously been used to treat asthma and na-\\nsal congestion.  Based on his own experiments, Dr.\\nNabenhauer independently recommended amphetamines\\nfor the relief of nasal congestion.  When SK&F became\\naware of Dr. Alles’ research, they proposed a coopera-\\ntive alliance for its development.  By 1932, “Benzedrine”\\nhad become SK&F’s first really big product.  Much of\\nthe money made from “Benzedrine” was returned di-\\nrectly into research, and the company began to expand.\\nShortly thereafter, in 1934, Dr. Rudolph H. Blythe, a\\npharmacist, arrived on the scene to organize the Phar-\\nmaceutical Research Section, which he directed until\\nhis retirement in 1966.\\nGlenn E. Ullyot was the third chemist to be hired,\\nin 1937, joining some 225 fellow employees at an ill-\\nequipped building (formerly an abattoir during the Civil\\nWar) at Delaware Avenue and Poplar Streets.  Two very\\nsignificant additions to the scientific team in the late\\n1930s were Dr. Edward J. Fellows, a pharmacologist,\\nand Dr. Arthur E. Heming, a biochemist.  They, together\\nwith Dr. Ullyot, were named Associate Directors of R&D\\nin 1957.  (When Ullyot retired in 1975, there were al-\\nmost 13,000 employees.)  In 1943 organic chemistry\\nbecame one of a number of scientific sections in the\\nrapidly mushrooming laboratory groups under the di-\\nrection of Dr. Walter Kerr, a biochemist.  By 1950, the\\norganic staff, under the direction of Dr. Ullyot, num-\\nbered eighteen persons, including the following Ph.D.s:\\nPaul N. Craig, James F. Kerwin, James W. Wilson III,\\nand Charles L. Zirkle.  These chemists, subsequently\\njoined by Andrew Anderson, and Drs. Bryce Douglas,\\nBernard Loev, Irwin Pachter, Robert F. Raffauf, Blaine\\nSutton, and Joseph Weinstock, formed the nucleus of an\\never-expanding research team.\\nWhile SK&F was conducting its research on am-\\nphetamines, it was discovered that they exert a signifi-\\ncant effect on the central nervous system. In 1939, SK&F\\nbegan to investigate potential modifications of amphet-\\namines and found one that was twice as effective as\\n“Benzedrine.”  Researchers started to explore possible\\nmedical applications;  the result was “Dexedrine,”\\nbrought out in 1944 and marketed as a mood lifter and\\nappetite suppressor.  It soon found other applications,\\nhowever, including use as a treatment for narcolepsy\\nand for the reduction of post-surgical effects of anes-\\nthesia.\\nAfter World War II, SK&F continued to grow, and\\nthe company recognized the need for better facilities.\\nIn 1948 construction began on a big, yellow brick build-\\n18\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\ning at 1530 Spring Garden Street.  This was the former\\nsite of the Baldwin Locomotive Works and, before that,\\nof Bush Hill, said to have been the home of Alexander\\nHamilton.  (Today this building is used primarily as a\\nmanufacturing facility.)\\nThe development of Spansules was the next big\\nsuccess in the parade of products at SK&F.  Beginning\\nin 1945, Dr. Harold A. Clymer began looking for a time-\\nrelease mechanism.  In 1949 the group leader, Dr. Donald\\nR. MacDonnell, while shopping in a supermarket, hap-\\npened to note a container of nonpareils, little chocolate\\ndiscs covered with a pebbling of white granules.  Why\\nnot fill capsules with granules coated with medication\\nthat would dissolve at different intervals?  This device\\nenabled the medication to release the required initial dose\\nrapidly, and then to release gradually very small doses\\nto maintain a therapeutic level for ten to twelve hours.\\nThe “Spansule” sustained release capsule, the result of\\nseven years of research and over 35,000 man-hours, was\\nfirst used for “Dexedrine” in 1952.  It became most fa-\\nmous eight years later, however,  as the “tiny time pills”\\nin “Contac,” the first all-day cold remedy and the\\ncompany’s best-selling cold medicine.\\nThe First Major Breakthrough\\nAs a result of focused research on a substance with infi-\\nnite possibilities, a new and exciting chapter in SK&F\\nhistory opened.  The success demonstrated the skills and\\nforesight of Francis Boyer, then Executive Vice-Presi-\\ndent of the company, who was bilingual in the French\\nlanguage, and Dr. Wesler Scull.  Boyer and Scull went\\nto France to investigate the licensing of a new drug\\nknown as chlorpromazine.  It was a mysterious com-\\npound, with many properties.  The French thought of it\\nas a “potentiator,” a substance which prolonged the ac-\\ntion of other drugs.  Although two other American drug\\ncompanies had turned down this compound, SK&F re-\\nsearchers, led by Dr. J. Kapp Clark, later Director of\\nResearch and Development, wanted to study it.  They\\nconfirmed the laboratory pharmacology reported by the\\nFrench and in SK&F clinical tests it was shown that the\\ndrug was indeed effective.  So, Boyer continued talks\\n(in French!) with Rhône-Poulenc; in 1952, SK&F was\\noffered the opportunity to license chlorpromazine.  Al-\\nthough chlorpromazine was found to possess several\\npossible medical applications, Dr. Scull, then Director\\nof Development Research, felt that the most important\\napplication was its astonishing calming effect on vio-\\nlent mental patients.  The drug actually rescued patients\\nfrom their psychotic states and restored them to lucid-\\nity.  Boyer and SK&F agreed to pursue the use of chlo-\\nrpromazine in mental illness, and in 1954 “Thorazine”\\nwas approved by the FDA for use in nausea and vomit-\\ning, and in neuropsychiatry.  Though Freudian psychia-\\ntrists initially resisted the idea of using chemical treat-\\nment, “Thorazine” and its sister drugs “Compazine,”\\nacquired from the same French company, and\\n“Stelazine,” were quickly developed as useful drugs and\\nwere widely adopted in mental hospitals.  The last men-\\ntioned drug was prepared in a classical extension of de-\\nveloping on a “lead” compound in Dr. Ullyot’s Medici-\\nnal Chemistry Section, notably by Dr. Craig.\\nFrom the historical standpoint,  chlorpromazine and\\nthe alkaloid reserpine are the two substances which en-\\ncouraged a chemotherapeutic approach to mental illness.\\nDr. Ullyot and Dr. Maxwell Gordon noted in their 1968\\narticle in the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical\\nTechnology (1):\\n…electroshock, insulin shock, prefrontal lobotomy,\\netc, were thought to be the answer when they were\\nfirst introduced.  But the relative undesirability of\\nthese treatments can be judged by the fact that in some\\nhospitals today they are virtually no longer employed\\nas routine measures in psychotherapy... In modern\\ninstitutions today there is a marked absence of the\\nrestraining devices, cold packs, noise, agitation, and\\nconfusion that have always characterized the mental\\ndisease wards.\\nFrancis Boyer.  As Executive Vice-President of the\\ncompany, in the early 1950s he helped to negotiate the\\ndeal with Rhône-Poulenc that enabled SK&F to license\\nchlorpromazine.  Photo courtesy SmithKline Beecham.\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n19\\nThus, treating mental illness with drugs proved to be a\\nfar more humane method than electroshock therapy or\\nprefrontal lobotomy.  The result was a dramatic, wide-\\nspread release of mental patients from state institutions.\\nIn the US the resident mental patient population dropped\\n4.8% between 1965 and 1966, and 19% between 1955\\nand 1966 (1).\\nThe Next Big Development\\nThe next big development was in the field of diuretics,\\none which SmithKline entered in 1955.  The goal was a\\nsafe, effective, orally active diuretic.  After years of test-\\ning many compounds for diuretic activity by a team in-\\ncluding Dr. Joseph Weinstock and led by Dr. Ullyot, the\\nFDA approved “Dyrenium” in 1964, almost three years\\nafter the government evaluation began.  Soon after\\nSK&F’s entrance into the field of diuretics, Dr. David\\nWheatley noticed an article in the British Medical Jour-\\nnal which indicated that the same substance that gave\\ncolor to butterfly wings also caused hyperplasia, enlarge-\\nment of the kidney (2).  Dr. Virgil Wiebelhaus, who\\njoined the diuretic group in 1956, began to investigate\\nthis substance, a pteridine compound.  For almost a de-\\ncade, SK&F scientists tested various pteridine com-\\npounds.  None was completely successful, however, until\\ntriamterene.  The diuretic team had endured several years\\nof research and two clinical failures, but its members\\nwere confident they were on the right course with pte-\\nridines.  In 1958, preliminary tests on triamterene indi-\\ncated that it had good diuretic properties, and by 1960,\\nclinical trials had been initiated.  Dyrenium was com-\\npounded with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to make\\n“Dyazide.”  HCTZ, a member of the group known as\\nthiazides, was then in use as a diuretic, but it had the\\npotentially harmful property of depleting potassium from\\nthe human body.  The new dual compound, however,\\novercame this problem.\\nAlthough SK&F’s marketing staff was less than\\nenthusiastic, “Dyazide” did extremely well; along with\\n“Contac” it carried the company through some lean times\\nin the late 1960s and the early 1970s, when the\\n“Thorazine” patent expired and the price fell.  In fact,\\nduring this period there were no new breakthrough drugs\\nin the development stage, and the company was forced\\nreluctantly to discharge 200 employees in 1969.  There\\nhad been a discouraging venture into the unfamiliar field\\nof cosmetics, aimed at the teen market under the brand\\nname of “Love,” and suntan products, “Sea & Ski.”\\nThe Tagamet Story\\nOf the four primary products discussed in this paper,\\n“Tagamet” became by far the most profitable.  How-\\never, it has been said that, without the income from\\n“Dyazide,” there would have been no funds to support\\nthe research that led to “Tagamet.”  Developed in the\\nmid-1970s by a team of British scientists including Dr.\\nJames Black, Dr. William A. M. Duncan, Dr. C. J.\\nDurant, Dr. C. Robin Ganellin, and Dr. E. M. Parsons,\\nall working at SK&F’s laboratory at Welwyn Garden\\nCity, England, “Tagamet,” also known as cimetidine, is\\na histamine blocker, an H2-receptor antagonist, which\\nwas designed to treat peptic ulcers and other gastrointes-\\ntinal disorders.  When he joined SK&F in 1969, Dr.\\nBlack already held a theory concerning histamines.  He\\nknew that they encouraged gastric acid production in\\nstomach cells and believed that, through application of\\nhis previous work on beta-blockers, it would be pos-\\nsible to inhibit this production.  His predictions proved\\ncorrect; by pursuing this avenue of research, Dr. Black\\nand his team were able to develop a receptor-specific\\nantagonist for histamines.  The histamine research was\\nslow:  in the first four years of work, Dr. Black’s team\\nsynthesized over 200 compounds, with no success.  In\\nthe meantime, SK&F was discharging employees. The\\ndirectors in Philadelphia were considering shutting down\\nthe program but ultimately decided to give the British\\nresearchers a little more time.  The British team did not\\ndisappoint Philadelphia!  It soon identified a possible\\nactive compound.  Although the first few efforts resulted\\nin antagonists which were either too weak or too toxic,\\nthe third attempt was a success, and “Tagamet,” the\\nworld’s first H2-receptor antagonist, came into being (3).\\nIntroduced in Great Britain in 1976, it was released in\\nthe United States less than a year later.  Almost immedi-\\nately “Tagamet” became an extremely popular method\\nof treating ulcers, not because it was more effective than\\nother traditional antacids, but because when it was taken\\ndaily, it helped to prevent the recurrence of ulcers. Sir\\nJames Black received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in\\n1988 for his work on beta-blockers and H2 blockers.\\nIt should be noted that on November 24, 1997 in\\nHarlow, UK and again on February 27, 1998 in King of\\nPrussia, Pennsylvania, the discovery of histamine H2-\\nreceptor antagonists was designated as an International\\nHistoric Chemical Landmark, conferred jointly by The\\nRoyal Society of Chemistry and the American Chemi-\\ncal Society.\\n20\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nThe Continued Growth of SK&F\\nIn 1973, the firm’s name was changed to SmithKline\\nCorporation and SmithKline & French Laboratories—\\ncarrying on the name so familiar for 82 years—was re-\\ntained for the pharmaceutical division. The company was\\nwell positioned for expansion and growth.  By 1982 a\\nnew $48 million headquarters had been built in\\nPhiladelphia’s Franklin Plaza and later, a large, modern\\nresearch facility in King of Prussia, Upper Merion, a\\nsuburb of Philadelphia. The firm had also acquired\\nAllergan, an eye and skin care business, and Beckman\\nInstruments, a California-based company which special-\\nized in diagnostic and measurement instruments.  As a\\nresult, the company became known as SmithKline\\nBeckman, a name it retained for almost a decade.\\nAllergan and Beckman Instruments were spun off in\\n1989 when SmithKline Beckman merged with Britain’s\\nBeecham Group, forming today’s SmithKline Beecham.\\nThis merger resulted in a company that is one of the\\nworld’s largest research and development organizations,\\nwith annual sales of over 12 billion dollars.  Today,\\nSmithKline Beecham is recognized for its cutting-edge\\nscientific research and its many successful product de-\\nvelopments.  Much of this success has been due to good\\nmanagement and excellent marketing.  However, it is\\nfundamentally the talented and hardworking individu-\\nals, the scientists dedicated to basic research, who have\\nenabled SmithKline Beecham to become the company\\nwhich today is known and respected around the world.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nThe authors wish to express their appreciation for the\\ninvaluable contributions of Tracy Sullivan of the Chemi-\\ncal Heritage Foundation and of Dr. Paul N.

In fact, Sterling operated a plant in\\nthat town until 1962.\\nThe history of the Corporation can conveniently\\nbe divided into five periods:\\n1901-1917 The Neuralgyline Period\\n1917-1928 Sterling Products I\\n1928-1933 Drug Inc.\\n1933-1942 Sterling Products II\\n1942-1988 Sterling Drug, Inc.\\nThe Neuralgyline Period\\nOn May 4, 1901, Weiss and Diebold, with three local\\nbusiness men as partners, established the Neuralgyline\\nCompany with the sole purpose of manufacturing and\\nselling a pain-relieving preparation which they called\\n“Neuralgine.”  There is now no company record of its\\ncomposition, but it seems to have been a mixture of ac-\\netanilide, caffeine, and sodium salicylate.  Total sales\\nin 1901 were $10,000.  During 1902 that entire amount\\nwas invested in advertising, partly in the Pittsburgh\\nnewspapers and partly on signs nailed to trees and posts.\\nThis generated sales of $60,000 in 1902 and set a pat-\\ntern for the future.  Over the next few years, the other\\nTHE LIFE CYCLE OF STERLING DRUG, INC.*\\nJoseph C. Collins and John R. Gwilt\\npartners were bought out.  Weiss and Diebold realized\\nthat expansion required more product lines and that these\\nwould best be obtained by acquisition.  This policy con-\\ntinued throughout the life of the organization, at least\\n130 companies being acquired, directly or indirectly,\\nfrom 1902 through 1986.  Ironically, the eventual fate\\nof Sterling Drug was its acquisition by Eastman Kodak\\nin 1988.\\nPurchase of the Knowlton Danderine Company in\\n1906 brought the first major brand.  The name “Ster-\\nling” came with the acquisition of the Sterling Remedy\\nFigure 1.

The formula, however,\\nwas strongly constipating, so Kramer developed a prod-\\nuct containing cascara, which he named “Cascarets;”\\nthis was much the more successful product.  Another\\nlaxative product, but based on\\nsenna, came with the Califor-\\nnia Fig Syrup Company in\\n1912.  The corporation also di-\\nversified into advertising via\\nThompson-Koch \\n(still\\nSterling’s in-house agency\\nthrough 1985) and other agen-\\ncies.  In 1913, Weiss and\\nDiebold, recognizing the need\\nfor improved financial organi-\\nzation, set up Synthetic Pat-\\nents.  This division held intan-\\ngible assets (trademarks, etc.)\\nand tangible assets (offices and\\nplants) separately from the\\ntrading activities.  Then in\\n1914, with World War I looming, they set up Propri-\\netary Agencies as an overseas trading company.\\nSterling Products I\\nBy 1917, Neuralgine was no longer a major product,\\nand the company name—Neuralgyline—was difficult\\nto say and remember.  Weiss and Diebold reviewed the\\ntrading names available and switched to Sterling Prod-\\nucts.  Because supplies of drugs from Germany had been\\ncut off by the Allied blockade, they set up the Winthrop\\nCompany to manufacture the active ingredients.  After\\nthe entry of the US into World War I on April 6, 1917,\\nthe Custodian of Enemy Property began seizing the as-\\nsets of German companies.  Those of Bayer were taken\\nover on January 10, 1918; and on December 12, 1918\\nthey were offered for auction at the Bayer plant in\\nRensselaer, NY.   Weiss, the successful bidder, acquired\\nBayer for $5.3 million.  He sold the dyestuffs division\\nof the business to Grasselli for $1.5 million; this passed\\nsuccessively to GAF (General Aniline and Film) and\\nthen in 1984 to BASF.\\nSterling’s Long-term Relationship with\\nBayer\\nThe Bayer Company had been established in Germany\\nin 1863 by Friedrich Bayer, a dyestuffs merchant, and\\nJohann Weskott, a cotton dyer.  Carl Duisberg was hired\\nas a research chemist in 1884 and sought a use for sur-\\nplus p-nitrophenol.  This led to the introduction of\\nacetophenetidine under the trade name Phenacetin.  All\\nBayer’s requirements in the US were imported from Ger-\\nmany, but US customs duties were so onerous that com-\\npetitors smuggled in supplies\\nfrom other sources through\\nCanada and Mexico and thus\\ndominated the market.\\nAcetylsalicylic acid was first\\nmarketed in 1899 in Germany un-\\nder the trademark Aspirin.\\nPrompted by its loss of sole rights\\nto phenacetin, Bayer attempted to\\npatent aspirin and to protect the\\ntrademark wherever possible. It\\nhad been a policy of German in-\\ndustry to protect its monopolies\\nby not manufacturing outside\\nGermany.  However a new US\\ntariff law made it necessary to\\nmanufacture dyestuffs and pharmaceuticals within the\\ncountry, so in 1903 Duisberg visited the US to review\\nmanufacturing opportunities.  As far back as 1881, Bayer\\nhad purchased 25% of the Hudson River Aniline and\\nColor works at Riverside Avenue, Rensselaer, New York.\\nDuisberg decided to acquire the outstanding equity and\\nto remodel this plant.  He also bought the American Color\\nand Chemical facility on Rensselaer Island and moved\\nits equipment to Riverside Avenue.  In the US, Bayer\\ncontinued to defend its monopoly of aspirin by threat-\\nening lawsuits against anyone, especially pharmacies,\\nselling material from other sources.  When the patent\\nexpired in February 1917, the trademark was reduced\\nto generic status by the concerted efforts of other sup-\\npliers, notably Lehn & Fink (which, paradoxically, was\\nacquired by Sterling in 1966) and by United Drug (which\\nassociated with Sterling in 1928 to form Drug Inc.).\\nBayer had promoted aspirin as an ethical medicine,\\nsold only through pharmacies.   Sterling now positioned\\nit with their patent medicines and increased sales dra-\\nmatically in the US (and in Canada where “Bayer Aspi-\\nrin” attained trademark status) over the next six decades.\\nBy contrast, Bayer Aspirin was sold by Sterling as an\\nethical medicine in the UK, Australia, and some other\\nmarkets; sales dwindled and the product had generally\\ndisappeared from those markets by the 1960s.  Bayer\\nattempted to recover its name and the Bayer Cross trade-\\nmark in various markets over the years.  In 1970, Ster-\\nFigure  2.   The first product:  Neuralgine.\\n24\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nling surrendered them in territories other than the US,\\nCanada, Jamaica, and Trinidad for a consideration of\\n$2.8 million.  In 1986, with the agreement of Sterling,\\nthe Rhinechem Corporation (a US holding company)\\nwas renamed Bayer USA Inc.  Finally, when Sterling\\nwas broken up in 1994, Bayer USA was able to buy\\nback the Bayer Aspirin business.\\nSterling continued with pharmaceutical acquisi-\\ntions, such as Phillips Milk of Magnesia in 1923.  The\\nfirst entry into a specialized dental business came in 1927\\nwith acquisition of Cook Laboratories, manufacturers\\nof dental syringes, and this was complemented in 1928\\nby the Antidolor Company, which produced dental an-\\nesthetics and other adjuncts.   Sterling Products now\\ntook a surprising change of direction.\\nDrug Inc.\\nIn 1900, Louis Kroh Liggett established a medicines dis-\\ntribution business in Boston, Mass., and found that many\\ndrug stores were compounding their own proprietary\\npreparations.  He persuaded forty of them to subscribe\\n$4,000 each to set up a central manufacturing facility in\\nthe Back Bay area.  The original druggists formed a loose\\nassociation as the “Rexall” agents (“Rexall” meaning\\n“king of all”).  With expansion of the business a more\\nformal structure was required, and the United Drug\\nCompany was established in 1916.  Other manufactur-\\ning companies were acquired, mostly to supply\\nnonmedicinal products, e.g., stationery (Marcus Ward),\\nrubber goods (seamless rubber), dressings (absorbent\\ncotton).  Because promotional costs were low, Rexall\\nproducts were priced very competitively and by 1930\\nthere were about 10,000 Rexall agencies in North\\nAmerica.  On the death or retirement of the owners,\\nLiggett purchased outlets and operated them under his\\nown name.  He also acquired the Owl Drug chain in the\\nwestern US and the May chain of Pittsburgh.  By 1930\\nhe controlled 706 stores in North America.  His only\\noverseas venture had been to acquire the Boots Pure\\nDrug Company in the UK in 1920.   Boots then had\\nsome 860 retail stores and they too made their own-brand\\nproducts that sold at a low mark up.  Later they also\\nmanufactured products for Sterling Drug and for Upjohn\\nand for Vick; this had become necessary because of high\\nUK import duties on finished medicines.\\nTwo ideas men—George M. Gales of United Drug\\nand Al Diebold of Sterling Products—were good friends\\nand seem to have been responsible for the concept of an\\nassociation of the two companies.  Each company was\\nmaking about $7 million annual profit.   Sterling spent\\nheavily on advertising and marketing; United Drug con-\\ntrolled about 20% of the estimated 60,000 drugstores in\\nNorth America.  Sterling’s products would of course not\\nbecome exclusive to United Drug outlets, but the Liggett\\nstores and the Rexall agents would receive special terms;\\nin return, they would give better displays and run pro-\\nmotions.  United Drug and Sterling Products were there-\\nFigure 3.  The Bayer plant at Rensselaer, NY, purchased by Weiss in 1918.\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n25\\nfore consolidated on March 2, 1928 into a new holding\\ncompany, Drug Incorporated.  It was a colossal outfit\\nfor its time, with about 37,000 employees.  In 1930, not\\na year noted for prosperity, the sales of Drug Inc. were\\nover $160 million; and its net income was about $21\\nmillion (at 1999 values, these figures would be $1.5 bil-\\nlion and $196 million, respectively).  But the strength\\nof the new organization lay in the fact that the original\\ncomponents continued to act independently.  Indeed Ster-\\nling continued to acquire companies, such as Life Sav-\\ners, Bristol-Myers, and Vick.\\nThere was no regulatory or other legal opposition\\nto the formation of Drug Inc., nor any legal pressures to\\nbreak it up.  The difficult issue was the question as to\\nhow the profits should be shared.  United Drug had as-\\nsumed a heavy debt burden, particularly with the acqui-\\nsition of the Owl Drug chain where Liggett was buying\\nsales volume rather than earnings.  In 1932, Sterling’s\\nprofitability was about 30% of sales, as compared to\\nUnited’s 5%.  Eventually there was agreement on a Plan\\nof Reorganization, dated August 7, 1933.  For every ten\\nshares in Drug Inc., a stockholder received five in Ster-\\nling Products, four in United Drug, two in Vick, two in\\nBristol-Myers, and one in Life Savers; and the business\\nwas partitioned along those lines.  Drug Inc. existed for\\njust five years and five months.  It traded while the\\neconomy sank into the depths of the depression.   Yet its\\nsales and profits continued to grow and it broke up\\nsmoothly with little impact upon individuals.\\nSterling Products II\\nThe pace of acquisitions increased.  The dental business\\nwas strengthened by the addition of R.L. Watkins (Dr.\\nLyons’ Tooth Powder) and Delatone.  The American\\nFerment Company brought a range of products based\\non papain.  Creamalin antacid came with the Cleveland\\nChemical Company.  Other major acquisitions included\\nthe Ironised Yeast range, and the pHisoDerm products\\n(Fairchild Brothers and Foster) which later led to\\npHisoHex, a major surgical scrub.\\nUp to this time, overseas business had not been a\\nmajor preoccupation.  The Proprietary Agencies divi-\\nsion exported packed stock.  Phillips Milk of Magnesia\\nwas manufactured by Boots in the UK, and California\\nSyrup of Figs was made by Parke-Davis in the UK, South\\nAfrica, and Australia; but these arrangements were made\\nto avoid excessive import duties on packed stock.  The\\nfirst big move towards foreign business came with the\\nacquisition in 1938 of the Sydney Ross Company of\\nNewark, New Jersey, which had several plants in Latin\\nAmerica.  This put Sterling in a strong position to fill\\nthe void left by the interruption of supplies from Eu-\\nrope (and especially from IG Farbenindustrie) to those\\nmarkets during and following World War II.  Marketing\\nwas supported by the formation of International Adver-\\ntising Services in 1941.\\nDuring the period 1920 through 1926 Sterling had\\nentered into a series of agreements with IG\\nFarbenindustrie of Germany, with the general aware-\\nness of the authorities in Washington.  However, under\\nthe trading conditions arising from the outbreak of World\\nWar II in Europe, these agreements were declared to be\\nin breach of the anti-trust laws, and in December 1941\\nWeiss and Diebold had to resign.  Weiss, returning to\\nWheeling, WV, died in an automobile accident in Sep-\\ntember 1942.  Diebold retired to Palm Beach, FL, and\\ndied in 1964; his official obituary refers to him as the\\nfounder of American Home Products and of the\\nNeuralgyline Company; there is no reference to Ster-\\nling.\\nSterling Drug, Inc.\\nEdward S. Hills, a semi-retired lawyer whose firm had\\nrepresented Sterling in trade mark negotiations, was\\nnamed the new chairman of Sterling; but the effective\\noperating officer was the former treasurer, James Hill,\\nJr., who kept Sterling on course.  Because of possible\\nconfusion with other companies’ names, Sterling Prod-\\nucts could not be licensed to carry on business in cer-\\ntain states and so on October 15, 1942 the company name\\nwas changed to Sterling Drug, Inc.  A major acquisition\\nin 1942 was the Salvo Chemical Corporation.  It had\\nbeen founded in 1930 to convert lignin from lumber\\nwastes into vanillin.  Sterling already sold this compound\\nfor flavorings through its General Drug division; but be-\\ncause the big tonnages were used in rubber for tires,\\nSterling was now in the critical war materials business.\\nEffluent treatment was a problem until Salvo found that\\nthe organic content was destroyed by aeration in water\\nat high temperatures and pressures, leading to the Zimpro\\nprocess used, for example, for the treatment of sewage\\nsludge in major cities such as Chicago.  Fortuitously,\\nthe reaction is exothermic and so actually generates en-\\nergy.  The Frederick Stearns Company, founded in 1855\\nalso by a pharmacist, was bought by Sterling in 1944.  It\\nowned the Nyal trademark, having acquired the New\\nYork and London Medicine Company in 1904, but this\\nproduct range was better known in Australia.  The medi-\\ncal director of Stearns, Mark Hiebert, MD, became presi-\\n26\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\ndent of Sterling in 1955 and succeeded Hill as chairman\\nin 1962 on the latter’s untimely death.  (Hiebert in turn\\nwas succeeded in 1972 by Clarke Wescoe, MD, a former\\nChancellor of the University of Kansas; when he retired\\nin 1984, Jack Pietruski became chairman).  In 1945 the\\nHilton-Davis Company was acquired, partly to comple-\\nment the existing chemicals operations at Rensselaer but\\nmore particularly as a captive source of salicylic acid\\n(the increasing demand for acetylation by the Bayer\\nAspirin process led to the purchase also of the McKay\\nDavis Chemical Company in 1947).\\nSterling’s first move into vaccines and sera came\\nin 1954 when the Bayer Biological Institute was set up\\nin former racing stables near Newmarket, England.\\nSuperannuated racehorses were used to produce anti-\\nbodies for veterinary preparations.  This and the rest of\\nthe UK veterinary business were sold to Pfizer in 1962.\\nMeanwhile in the US, various poultry vaccine businesses\\n(Dorn & Mitchell, Delaware Poultry Laboratories) were\\nacquired in 1958 and sold in 1985.  Other ventures into\\nbiologicals included a short-lived human influenza vac-\\ncine unit at Rensselaer in 1965 and a range of fluores-\\ncent antibodies for the rapid identification of microor-\\nganisms, made and sold in the UK from 1966 through\\n1969.\\nThe next big leap in growth came in 1958.  Until\\nthat time, most foreign activity was in Latin America\\n(through the Sydney Ross Company) and through un-\\ncoordinated units in Australasia, the Philippines, South\\nAfrica, and the UK.  Canada operated virtually as part\\nof the US, but business in most other countries was car-\\nried on through agents.  The reorganisation outside the\\nUS was based more on personalities than on logic.\\nHowever, it did lead to the setting up of Sterling com-\\npanies in many more countries: in virtually all those in\\nwestern Europe, in the major countries in Africa and the\\nMiddle East, in India and Pakistan, and elsewhere.  This\\nexpansion was accompanied by the building of a num-\\nber of new manufacturing plants.  Changes in local regu-\\nlations and in trade agreements meant that there was a\\nshifting pattern of agency and manufacturing arrange-\\nments over the years; but, during its last two decades of\\nexistence, Sterling generally operated about seventy\\nplants located in about forty countries and had direct or\\nagency marketing in over 130 countries.\\nDespite all this activity, the policy of acquisition\\ncontinued, but the emphasis moved towards household\\nand similar consumer goods.  Perhaps the most impor-\\ntant acquisition was that of Lehn & Fink in 1966.\\nFounded in New York in 1874, the business had been\\none of the major players in breaking Bayer’s strangle-\\nhold on aspirin in the US in 1917.  It brought with it\\nsubsidiaries, notably Schulke & Mayr (disinfectants in\\nWest Germany), Hinds (cosmetic creams), and Beacon\\nWax.  A further disinfectant manufacturer, Phagogène\\nin France, was added in 1971.  In 1973, Sterling ac-\\nquired the Izal business in the UK, a move that largely\\ncomplemented the Lehn & Fink operations.  Izal was\\nfounded in 1880 to sell household disinfectants and now\\nincluded furniture polishes (Ronuk), floor treatments and\\nother cleaning systems, and barrier creams.  The Ronuk\\ndivision went on to develop various do-it-yourself wood\\ntreatment products.   Sterling then acquired a similar\\nUS firm Minwax in 1977, and Thompson and Formby\\n(waterproofing of brickwork and other exterior surfaces)\\nin 1986.  There was a return to pharmaceutical acquisi-\\ntions in 1985 and 1986—notably Maggioni of Italy—\\nand then Sterling came to the end of the road.\\nThe Fate of Sterling\\nOn January 4, 1988, Hofmann-La Roche made a hostile\\nbid to take over the entire assets of Sterling Drug, Inc.\\nSterling in turn sought a “white knight” and on Febru-\\nary 22, 1988, Sterling became a division of Eastman\\nKodak for the sum of  $5.1 billion.  Eastman Kodak saw\\nSterling—especially its ethical pharmaceuticals and its\\ndiagnostic imaging—as complementary to its own health\\nsciences business.  In particular the facilities in Sterling’s\\nmajor research centers in Rensselaer (NY), Alnwick\\n(UK), and Dijon (France) would be of great help in\\nscreening and evaluating compounds available to\\nEastman Kodak.  It was decided to centralize all US\\nresearch in magnificent new facilities in Upper Provi-\\ndence Township, PA. The building was only partly oc-\\ncupied, however, when Eastman Kodak decided in 1994\\nto dispose of its health-related businesses.  The Sterling\\nsegment was broken up as follows:\\nIn 1991 Sanofi and Sterling had formed a strategic\\nalliance, so in 1994 Sanofi bought Sterling’s worldwide\\nethicals business for $1.675 billion and immediately sold\\nthe diagnostic imaging portion to Nycomed of Norway\\nfor $425 million.\\nSmithKline Beecham purchased the worldwide\\nover-the-counter pharmaceuticals business for $2.9 bil-\\nlion and promptly sold the US portion to Bayer for $1\\nbillion.

Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nIntroduction\\nBy the end of the Civil War Detroit was a prosperous\\nand bustling city.  The completion of the locks and ca-\\nnal at Sault Ste. Marie in 1855 had opened the way for\\ntransporting the iron ore and copper from Michigan’s\\nUpper Peninsula to the markets in the east.  By 1860\\nMichigan was the largest producer of iron ore and cop-\\nper in North America (1).  Both of these products were\\ncritical in the North’s victory in the Civil War, and the\\nmining and transport of these materials was highly prof-\\nitable. In Detroit gracious homes lined the tree-shaded\\nstreets which led into Woodward Avenue, and the most\\nprosperous citizens were building mansions on estates\\nalong the river off of East Jefferson Boulevard.\\nTimes had not proven to be that prosperous, how-\\never, for Dr. Samuel Duffield, who owned a small drug\\nstore at the corner of Gratiot and Woodward Avenues.\\nThe experience of the Civil War and the large number\\nof people moving west had demonstrated the need for a\\ngreater supply of medicinal preparations (2).  So in 1862\\nDr. Duffield had begun to make a number of items in\\nlarger amounts than required for his own use and to sell\\nthem to other pharmacists and doctors.  Dr. Duffield’s\\nstore was strictly a one-man operation,  and most nights\\nfound him working late in the crowded laboratory in\\nthe back of his store.  Here he had a still that could pro-\\nduce two barrels of alcohol a day and presses for mak-\\ning extracts.  In the Detroit City Directory he advertised\\n“ether, sweet spirits of nitre, liquid ammonium,\\nHoffman’s anodyne, mercurial ointment, etc.”  But the\\nshipping service to Detroit was poor and potential cus-\\ntomers in the major population centers in the east were\\nskeptical of any company located in what they consid-\\nered to be a backwoods town.  Consequently, it was dif-\\nficult to find anyone to extend credit or to invest in such\\na business (3).\\nThen in 1866 Dr. Duffield met Hervey C. Parke\\nwho was interested in starting a new business.  Hervey\\nParke was 38 years old.  He had managed a copper mine\\nand then owned a successful hardware store in\\nMichigan’s Upper Peninsula.  In 1865 he sold his store\\nand moved his wife and two children back to Detroit\\nbecause of the better business opportunities there.  On\\nOctober 26, 1866, the partnership of Duffield and Parke\\nwas formed, and this event is recognized as the begin-\\nning of Parke-Davis and Company.\\nPart I – 1866-1900\\nSoon the increased competition of the eastern drug firms\\nmade the new partners realize the necessity of finding\\nsomeone who could promote and sell their products.  So\\nin 1867 a young, ambitious, wholesale drug salesman\\nwas brought into the firm as the third partner.  This was\\nGeorge S. Davis, the son of a prominent Detroit resi-\\ndent.  After high school he chose going into business\\nrather than attending college.  He was only 22 when he\\njoined the partnership, but he had already established\\nhimself as an outstanding salesman.  Although sales\\ncontinued to expand, new troubles kept appearing.  Dr.\\nDuffield’s health began to fail and he needed to spend\\nTHE EARLY HISTORY OF PARKE-DAVIS\\nAND COMPANY*\\nMilton L. Hoefle, Warner Lambert-Parke Davis\\nBull. Hist.

So in 1871 Parke and Davis became the\\nowners of the company that was to bear their name for\\nthe next century.\\nHervey Parke and George Davis had very different\\npersonalities.  Where the former was quiet, gray bearded,\\nand dignified, the latter was young, flamboyant, and full\\nof ideas for increasing their business.  Under their di-\\nrection the company entered an era of unprecedented\\ngrowth.  Both men were committed to the belief that the\\nhigh quality of their products was a major selling point,\\nand the motto “Medicamenta Vera” or “truth in medi-\\ncine,” first adopted by Dr. Duffield, continued to be one\\nof their major concerns.\\nIn order to gain both publicity and new products,\\nDavis began sending expeditions to far-off corners of\\nthe world to collect various plants used by the native\\npeoples.  Starting in 1871 expeditions were sent into the\\nwilds of Central and South America, Mexico, the Pa-\\ncific Northwest, the West Indies, and the Fiji Islands.\\nOver a twenty-year period, Parke-Davis introduced 50\\nnew drugs, and most of these proved to be of sufficient\\nvalue to be recognized in the United States Pharmaco-\\npoeia.  Probably the most familiar product, Cascara\\nSagrada, introduced in 1876, is still used today (4).\\nThe best-documented expedition financed by Parke-\\nDavis was that of Henry H. Rusby, who recorded his\\nadventures in a book called Jungle Memories (5).  Rusby\\nhad just received his medical degree from New York\\nUniversity, and he was hired by Parke-Davis as a “bota-\\nnist and pharmacognosist.”  Late in the fall of 1884\\nGeorge Davis asked him how soon he could leave for\\nBolivia because he wanted to obtain a large supply of\\ncoca leaves so that this drug could be investigated.\\nRusby quickly gathered up all the equipment that he\\nmight need and by January was on a boat headed to South\\nAmerica.  He was just 22 years old and setting out alone\\non a trip that would take two years.  He would cross the\\nIsthmus of Panama and travel down the rough western\\ncoast of South America to Bolivia.  From here he would\\ncross the Andes and then travel the length of the Ama-\\nzon River from its western tributaries to the Atlantic\\nOcean.  While in the Bolivian jungles Rusby kept hear-\\ning reports about the bark of a mystery tree called\\n“cocillana” which was reported to possess a remarkable\\nrange of therapeutic uses.  Finally a native identified\\nthis mysterious tree and Rusby immediately had it cut\\ndown and its bark removed and dried.  In order to test\\nthe properties he administered a small amount to one of\\nhis native companions and it produced an increase of\\nmucus in the mouth and throat.  A double dose was then\\ngiven to two other natives with similar results.  Thus\\nencouraged, Rusby again doubled the dose and took it\\nhimself.   The result was “nausea, pallor, and an abun-\\ndance of thin watery mucus from the nose.”  Based on\\nthese findings and what information he could gather,\\nRusby considered that this drug had properties similar\\nto those of ipecac and that it had commercial possibili-\\nties.  So he hired natives to gather 600 pounds of this\\nbark which was then packed, carried over the moun-\\ntains, and shipped back to Detroit.\\nIn the late 1800s Parke-Davis supplied a group of\\nleading physicians with samples of new products and\\nlittle pamphlets called “Working Bulletins.”  These pub-\\nGeorge S. Davis\\nHervey C. Parke\\n30\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nlications provided all the known information about the\\npreparations and their physiological effects.  In turn the\\nphysicians were invited to report their experience with\\nthe drug, which would then appear in later issues.  It is\\ninteresting to note that Cocillana bark was listed in the\\n1888 catalog just two years after Rusby sent back the\\nfirst sample.  Cocillana never replaced ipecac but even-\\ntually was utilized in cough preparations, and Rusby\\nreceived a royalty of 10 cents per pound of bark.\\nThe first manufacturing plant was located in down-\\ntown Detroit, but by 1873 the rapidly increasing demand\\nfor Parke-Davis products made it necessary to build new\\nmanufacturing facilities at Joseph Campeau Street and\\nthe Detroit River.  This location would be the home of\\nParke-Davis for the next century.  There were two ma-\\njor manufacturing operations; extracting plant materi-\\nals and rolling pills.  By 1874 the Parke-Davis catalog\\nlisted 254 types of fluid\\nextracts, 300 types of\\nsugar coated pills, 74\\nsolid extracts, 53 con-\\ncentrations, 46 medici-\\nnal elixirs, 23 medici-\\nnal syrups, 15 medici-\\nnal wines, 8 alkaloids,\\nand chloroform (6).\\nBecause \\naddi-\\ntional money was\\nneeded to finance the\\nexpansion, Davis had\\nthe job of trying to en-\\ncourage Detroit busi-\\nnesses to invest in the\\ncompany.  But money was tight following the recession\\nof 1873 and so it was not until January 14, 1875 that\\nParke-Davis and Company became a corporation under\\nMichigan law.  Parke was the president while Davis was\\nthe general manager, and there were three other stock-\\nholders who had paid in capital totaling about $82,000.\\nBy 1876, exactly 10 years after Duffield and Parke had\\njoined forces, the company reported its first profit of\\n$5,264.65 and Parke-Davis had become Detroit’s larg-\\nest industry next to manufacturing stoves.  During this\\nperiod George Davis was the real driving force.  In ad-\\ndition to selling, he managed the production and labo-\\nratory facilities; if salesmen were needed, he trained\\nthem.  Most importantly, his restless genius was respon-\\nsible for a number of brilliant and farsighted decisions\\nthat would result in Parke-Davis becoming one of the\\nmost respected pharmaceutical companies in the world\\nby the turn of the century.\\nOne of the major problems encountered by the phar-\\nmacists and physicians at that time was the variation in\\nthe strengths of the prepared medicinal extracts on the\\nmarket.  These could range from being worthlessly weak\\nto death-threateningly strong.  Obviously, the drug manu-\\nfacturers wanted to avoid the possibility of their prod-\\nucts killing anyone, so they tended to err on the weak\\nside. Consequently, most doctors felt more secure in ei-\\nther compounding the drugs themselves or dealing with\\na pharmacist they knew and trusted.  Davis was keenly\\naware of this situation and hired a chemist to work on\\nthe problem.  In 1879 a process for standardization by\\nchemical assay was developed, and the first standard-\\nized medicinal drug in history was placed on the mar-\\nket.  This led to a systematic investigation of standard-\\nizing other liquid formulations and in 1883 Parke-Davis\\nannounced a list of twenty such “normal liquids (7).”\\nBy the early\\n1890s medical re-\\nsearch scientists\\nbegan to realize the\\npotential useful-\\nness of animal\\nglands as a source\\nof new medicinals.\\nParke-Davis was\\nquick to begin re-\\nsearch in this new\\nfield and in 1893\\nintroduced desic-\\ncated thyroid gland\\nas a treatment for\\nglandular disor-\\nders.  Because the\\nnew biological materials did not lend themselves to\\nchemical standardization, in 1897 Parke-Davis intro-\\nduced the idea of physiological standardization in which\\nthe effect of the drug in test animals was quantified.  Two\\ndecades later over 1,100 Parke-Davis products would\\nbe standardized by these methods.\\nOther pharmaceutical companies recognized the\\nsignificance of standardization and developed methods\\nof their own so that over a relatively short period of\\ntime this principle was adopted by the whole industry.\\nHowever, Parke-Davis’ leadership and diligence were\\nwidely recognized and appreciated.  In order to main-\\ntain standards it was also necessary to establish quality\\ncontrol.  Thus, in 1886 Parke-Davis initiated the prac-\\ntice of using lot numbers on the labels of all their prod-\\nucts.  Since that time every item produced has carried\\nFirst factory\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n31\\nits own control number.  This number is the key to the\\ncomplete history of the product and each ingredient used\\nin its manufacturing including the source and testing.  It\\nwas not until 1962 that the FDA required all drug manu-\\nfacturers to do this.\\nBy 1890 Parke-Davis was a successful and pros-\\nperous company.  It had finally succeeded in breaking\\ninto the competitive eastern market, and a full-scale\\nmanufacturing operation was built in Walkerville,\\nOntario, to take care of that business.  In the same year\\na Parke-Davis branch was established in London, En-\\ngland, in order to enable the company to extend its sales\\nto Europe.  New buildings were also going up on the\\nwaterfront property, and the number of employees was\\nsteadily increasing.  A big bicycle shed was built on Jos.\\nCampeau to shelter all of the bicycles which were the\\nfavorite form of transportation.  Parke-Davis employed\\na large number of women, especially in the Capsule and\\nFinishing Departments.  The women wore long ankle-\\nlength skirts fashionable in that era, protected by starchy\\naprons brought from home. Work started at 7:00 a.m.\\nand ended at 5:30 p.m.; and on Saturday everyone\\nworked from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.  All of the capsules\\nwere handmade and the rate of pay for hand trimming\\nand joining capsules was 8¢ per thousand.  A top opera-\\ntor could earn up to 80¢ a day.\\nIt was at this time that George Davis met a young\\nJapanese chemist, Jokichi Takamine, who had come to\\nthe United States to try and interest the distilling indus-\\ntry in a potent starch-splitting enzyme that he had de-\\nveloped.  Davis was impressed and immediately hired\\nhim as a consultant.  Taka-Diastase was marketed in 1895\\nas a digestive aid and became very popular.  Once again\\nDavis’ intuitive ability to recognize talent was evident,\\nbecause in 1900 Takamine isolated adrenaline and was\\npart of the team working in the Parke-Davis laboratory\\nthat identified the chemical structure.  Later, after re-\\nturning to Japan, Takamine became the first president\\nof Sankyo.  Because of this common bond a close rela-\\ntionship has existed between the two companies since\\nthat time.\\nIn 1894 the German scientist, Emil Behring, and\\nthe French scientist, Emile Roux, announced the dis-\\ncovery of an antitoxin for the treatment of diphtheria.\\nGeorge Davis immediately realized that it would bring\\ntremendous prestige to his company if such an antitoxin\\ncould be produced commercially because at that time\\ndiphtheria was one of the most deadly of the common\\ndiseases.  Moving quickly, he recruited two scientists\\nfrom the University of Michigan to set up the first com-\\nmercial biological laboratory in this country.  On March\\n19, 1895, a Detroit physician administered a shot of\\nParke-Davis diphtheria antitoxin to an ailing company\\nemployee.  This marks the first time that a commercially\\nproduced serum was given to anyone in the United\\nStates.  Two years later Antistreptococcic and Antitetanic\\nserums were marketed.  In fact, the serums and vac-\\ncines that were developed in this biological laboratory\\nwere to provide the bulk of the sales for the next twenty-\\nfive years.\\nIt is ironic that just at the time that Parke-Davis\\nwas doing so well and George Davis was making deci-\\nsions and initiating actions that would shortly make it\\nthe most successful pharmaceutical company in the\\nworld, the personal life of Davis became chaotic and\\ntragic.  As the business prospered the lives of the two\\npartners grew apart.  Hervey Parke still quietly took care\\nof the finances.  Around Detroit he was known as a suc-\\ncessful, conservative man and a philanthropist.  On the\\nother hand, George Davis remained a bachelor although\\nhe was said to be an ardent admirer of beautiful women.\\nHe owned a big mansion on East Jefferson and a 500\\nacre farm on the lakefront where he kept his racehorses.\\nHe had a luxurious yacht for sailing on Lake St. Clair,\\nand he was a well-known and popular figure around\\nDetroit where he entertained lavishly.  A great admirer\\nof Napoleon Bonaparte, Davis had an extensive collec-\\ntion of relics of Napoleon.  He also liked to collect rare\\n“first editions” and by 1886 he owned a library of more\\nthan 5,000 books.  He became intrigued by the pros-\\npects of California real estate and invested large sums\\nof money, and this proved to be his undoing.\\nIn 1893 business was booming and then suddenly\\nthe bottom dropped out of the market.  The failure of\\nBritish banks had caused British investors to unload\\nAmerican securities for cash, the result being a drain of\\ngold reserves.  This caused Americans to become ap-\\nprehensive and to start withdrawing their savings from\\nthe banks.  In turn hundreds of banks failed, thousands\\nof businesses closed, and hundred of thousands of people\\nwere thrown out of work all across the country.  The\\ngreat panic of 1893 was on.  In the resulting depression\\nParke-Davis suffered only a minor setback, but George\\nDavis’ heavy investment in California land proved to\\nbe a catastrophe.  He lost vast sums of money, and in\\norder to cover some of his losses, he drew on Parke-\\nDavis for more money than he was due.  Naturally, the\\nstockholders objected.  Although Hervey Parke, the\\npresident, stood by his partner through the resulting\\n32\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nstorm, eventually it was necessary to ask Davis to re-\\nsign.  After almost 30 years of service, his stock was\\nturned in as partial payment of his indebtedness and he\\nwas given a “leave of absence.”  In order to pay off his\\ndebts Davis sold his mansion, his farm, his beloved\\nNapoleon collection, his yacht, and even his racehorses.\\nFrom the time that he had started with a salary of $60 a\\nmonth until his resignation in November, 1896, this un-\\nusual man had allowed over a million dollars to slip\\nthrough his fingers.  Suddenly after 30 years of hard\\nwork and brilliant leadership, everything was gone.  In\\n1903 he was forced to declare bankruptcy, and at that\\ntime the Board of Directors voted him a special pension\\nin recognition of his many contributions.  He lived qui-\\netly in various rooming houses and seemed to have no\\nregrets.  He seldom mentioned Parke-Davis but often\\ntalked about the beautiful racehorses he had owned.  He\\ndied in 1930 at the age of 85 and only a few people\\nattended the short burial service in Elmwood Cemetery.\\nAfter George Davis was forced to leave the firm,\\nHervey Parke continued as president, but was less and\\nless active in the actual management because of poor\\nhealth.  The prominent Detroiters who had bought Davis’\\nstock were named to the Board of Directors, and other\\nnames appeared more and more frequently in the com-\\npany records.  Then on February 8, 1899, Hervey Parke\\ndied.  At his funeral in Detroit’s St. John’s Episcopal\\nChurch the large sanctuary was so crowded that special\\nseating had to be reserved because all the leaders of\\nDetroit’s business and social life were present.\\nSo, we come to the end of an era.  Over the period\\nof slightly more than 30 years the efforts of two men\\nworking in concert had directed the development of a\\npharmaceutical company from obscurity to a position\\nof international prominence.  Indeed, by the spring of\\n1904 Parke-Davis proudly proclaimed itself to be “The\\nWorld’s Largest Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Con-\\ncern.”\\nThe middle of the 19th century was the time for\\npharmaceutical pioneers.  Familiar names like Merrill,\\nLilly, Squibb, and Warner all date back to this period.  It\\nalso marked the beginning of systematic research in the\\nfield of medicine.  Thus, in 1864 Louis Pasteur proved\\nthat airborne microbes caused fermentation and putre-\\nfaction.  In turn this work stimulated Lister to experi-\\nment with antiseptic agents, and this ushered in the\\nmodern age of surgery.  But the amazing success of\\nParke-Davis and Co. must be attributed to Davis’ abil-\\nity to recognize the importance of the new discoveries\\nand to find a way to capitalize on the new possibilities.\\nAt the same time Hervey Parke managed to balance the\\nenthusiasm of his young partner with a sense of reality\\nand to keep the company financially solvent during some\\nvery turbulent times.  The single most important contri-\\nbution to their success, however, was the development\\nof standards of purity and strict adherence to maintain-\\ning the quality of their products.  The favorable public-\\nity that resulted was the basis of Parke-Davis’ interna-\\ntional reputation, and as this reputation grew so did sales.\\nPart II – 1900-1974\\nThe beginning of the 20th century marked the start of a\\nnew era for Parke-Davis and for the United States.  The\\nautomobile had arrived.  In Detroit the police posted\\nspeed limits of 8 miles per hour in order to halt reckless\\ndriving.  The popular Theodore Roosevelt as President\\nwas busy reforming the government of the United States.\\nThe leading sentiment of the time was “There’s nothing\\nwrong with society that the government can’t fix.”\\nUnder Roosevelt America was becoming a world power\\nand there was recognition that human rights were as\\nimportant as the rights of property (8).  Americans had\\na new sense of pride in themselves and their country.\\nMost of all, everyone was enjoying prosperity.\\nThe founders of Parke-Davis were replaced by new\\nleaders, but everything else remained the same.  Since\\nthe company was so successful there was no need to\\nrisk being a pioneer and to blaze new trails.  With sales\\ncontinuing to grow the name Parke-Davis was recog-\\nnized throughout the world as being associated with the\\nhighest quality products available.  In no way did the\\nnew managers want to lose this reputation.  So from\\n1900-1930 subsequent managers were able to maintain\\nParke-Davis’ preeminent position by expanding upon\\nthat which the two partners had started.  Thus, the first\\ncommercial biological laboratory that George Davis had\\nestablished in 1894 was a major contributor to this suc-\\ncess. In the lab that started with three horses and a few\\nguinea pigs, the number of horses rapidly increased to\\nseveral hundred.  The company leased two large stables\\nadjoining their river front property from the Detroit\\nUnited Railway System, but soon these were over-\\ncrowded.  The city of Detroit was also expanding so\\nthat the Parke-Davis property was gradually surrounded\\nby residential areas.  So it was a very popular decision\\nin 1907 when the company purchased a large farm near\\nRochester, Michigan, and started moving all of the ani-\\nmals out there.  The animals at Parkedale were prob-\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n33\\nably the best fed and cared for in the world.  Horses\\nwere required for the production of serums used against\\ndiphtheria, tetanus, and gangrene.  During World War I\\nthere was a tremendous demand for Antitetanic Serum\\nand ultimately over 600 horses were kept on the farm.\\nThe period leading up to World War I was a happy\\ntime for the more than 3,000 employees of Parke-Davis.\\nThere were company picnics and boat excursions.  There\\nwere social clubs and dances, bowling leagues and com-\\npany sponsored athletic teams. The company pioneered\\na profit sharing and old age pension plan.  There was a\\ngeneral feeling of being a member of a big, happy fam-\\nily; and a strong mutual sense of loyalty developed be-\\ntween the company and its employees that would last\\nfor almost fifty years.  In 1927 F. O. Taylor, who was\\nChief Chemist at the time, wrote, “Long years of ser-\\nvice by those in both high and humble positions gives\\nto Parke-Davis and Company an espirit de corps of im-\\nmeasurable value and assurance that replacement in the\\nranks shall fully carry on, and indeed improve, the tra-\\nditions of the past (9).”  This company spirit was cer-\\ntainly helpful in the difficult times resulting from the\\ndepression that followed the stock market crash of 1929.\\nAll of the employees agreed to a cut in pay so that no\\none was laid off.  Profits were down but the company’s\\nrecord of never missing a dividend since the first one in\\n1878 was maintained (10).  But because of the focus on\\ntraditions the company began to fall slowly behind its\\ncompetitors in sales.\\nThis trend continued until 1946 when a soil sample\\ncollected from a field in Venezuela yielded an unusu-\\nally active antibiotic, Chloromycetin.  This unique sub-\\nstance showed outstanding activity against typhus and\\ntyphoid fever.  The structure was quickly identified, and\\nthe small group of organic chemists was successful in\\nsynthesizing the compound.  The development of this\\ndrug was accomplished in a remarkably short period of\\ntime.  By 1949 Chloromycetin was released to the medi-\\ncal profession, and within three years the sales of this\\nproduct alone totaled $120 million. The company had\\nregained its premier position in the US.\\nBy 1952 there was an increasing number of reports\\nof hypoplastic anemias following the administration of\\nChloromycetin.  At this time over eight million people\\nhad been treated successfully with this drug, and there\\nhad been remarkably little sign of any toxicity.  But con-\\ncern about this problem resulted in the council on Phar-\\nmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Associa-\\ntion issuing a report to the Committee on Research and\\nappointing a subcommittee on blood dyscrasias in June,\\n1952 (11).  This was followed up by a report of the Coun-\\ncil on Pharmacy and Chemistry in 1954 (12), which\\nadvised the restriction of the use of chloramphenicol to\\nthe treatment of typhoid fever and other infectious dis-\\neases caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics.\\nThe sales that initially plummeted in 1952 gradually\\nincreased so that by 1960 Parke-Davis once again led\\nall US pharmaceutical companies in sales. As the on-\\nslaught of bad publicity continued, the sales of\\nChloromycetin in the US gradually dwindled to almost\\nnothing.\\nBy 1961 Parke-Davis was in a downward spiral.\\nThe expansion brought about by the success of\\nChloromycetin had resulted in higher fixed costs, and\\nthere were no new products available to ease the pres-\\nsure.  Finally, a hostile takeover bid by Revlon forced\\nthe Board of Directors to consider alternative buyers of\\nthe company.  They settled on the New Jersey conglom-\\nerate, Warner-Lambert, which purchased Parke-Davis\\nin 1970.  The merger was finalized in 1974.\\nToday the old Parke-Davis plant at Joseph Campeau\\nand the Detroit River has been converted into a big\\nriverfront complex of apartment buildings, shopping\\ncenter, hotels, and upscale office buildings.  The name\\n“Parke-Davis” now identifies the ethical pharmaceuti-\\ncal division of the Warner Lambert corporate family.\\nThis division includes the former Parke-Davis research\\nfacility in Ann Arbor and the manufacturing plant at\\nHolland, Michigan.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThe author thanks the staff of the Parke-Davis Research\\nLibrary in Ann Arbor for their suggestions and help.

It was a\\nresult of an unprecedentedly peaceful period of the oth-\\nerwise stormy history of the country, which came about\\nafter the establishment of the dual Austro-Hungarian\\nMonarchy in 1867.  This generation produced the musi-\\ncians Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, the psychologists\\nSándor Ferenczy and Imre Hermann, the philosophers\\nGyörgy Lukács and Károly Mannheim, the economists\\nKároly Polányi and Miklós Káldor, the movie maker\\nAlexander Korda, and the writers Mihály Babits and\\nFrigyes Karinthy.\\nIn this extremely fertile soil a whole galaxy of sci-\\nentific geniuses was also formed. The names of George\\nvon Békésy and George von Hevesy, Eugene Wigner\\nand John von Neumann, Leo Szilárd and Edward Teller,\\nMichael Polányi and Theodore von Kármán, Albert\\nSzent-Györgyi, and Dennis Gábor became well known\\nall over the world, particularly, since many of them won\\nthe Nobel Prize and played crucial roles in developing\\nthe atomic bomb.  These scientists formed a more or\\nless closed circle and constituted what I call the Hun-\\ngarian phenomenon in 20th century science.  I define\\nthe latter this way. 1) Although the sciences in Hungary\\ndid not exceed an average level at that time, Hungarian\\nculture produced a highest-level group of scientists.  2)\\nCompared to the size of the population, the number of\\nthese highest-level scientists was exceptionally large.\\n3) These scientists, after a Hungarian middle class edu-\\ncation, left the country and achieved their success out-\\nside the country, mostly in the United States.  4) The\\nscientists under discussion formed a group, or at least a\\nnetwork; that is, they established contacts (a) to each\\nother, (b) to the other Hungarian emigrants, and (c) kept\\ntheir contacts with the Hungarian scientific community.\\n5) The group had some characteristic features that dis-\\ntinguished it from other scientific groups, and these fea-\\ntures can, in principle, be described.\\nThis paper raises the question as to whether the\\nHungarian phenomenon existed in several countries or\\nonly in the United States, and, particularly, whether or\\nnot it existed in Israel.  What kind of roles in general did\\nthe Hungarian natural scientists play in Israel?  Since\\nmany of the above mentioned scientists were of Jewish\\norigin, the question is more than justified.\\nEarly Science in Palestine\\nIn answering these questions, it should be taken into\\nconsideration that most of the Hungarian-phenomenon\\nscientists left Hungary around 1920, when the right-wing\\nand antisemitic Horthy government took over.  They\\nmoved to America or Great Britain from Germany when\\nthe Nazis won the 1933 election.  Though the interna-\\ntional Zionist movement, headed by Theodor Herzl (a\\ngraduate of the Budapest “fasori gimnazium,” the same\\nhigh school as Neumann and Wigner’s), was officially\\nestablished in 1897, it was only in 1917 that the Balfour\\n36\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\ndeclaration promised the establish-\\nment of a Jewish national state in\\nPalestine, a distant part of the Ot-\\ntoman empire. During the 1920s,\\nunder British administration, Jew-\\nish immigration into Palestine be-\\ngan to grow and, because of the\\nHolocaust, by the 1940s the coun-\\ntry became a target of the large\\nJewish exodus from various coun-\\ntries.\\nFor the first wave of the mi-\\ngrating Hungarian scientists, in-\\ncluding Szilárd, Neumann,\\nWigner, and Teller, around 1920,\\nIsrael could not compete with Ger-\\nmany, with its lively scientific life,\\nits modern laboratories, and great\\npersonalities.  The primary goal of\\nthese scientists was to study and\\nto become not just good but bril-\\nliant experts.  Israel at that time\\ncould not offer very much to these ambitious young\\npeople.\\nThough the idea of establishing a Jewish univer-\\nsity preceded even the first Zionist Congress, and Herzl\\nalso supported the idea, the Hebrew University’s twelve\\nfoundation stones, symbolizing the twelve tribes of Is-\\nrael, were laid “on the barren crest of Mount Scopus” in\\nJerusalem only in 1918 (1).  It was opened in 1925, one\\nyear later than the Technion, the institute of engineer-\\ning, which also was a result of an old desire to create a\\nschool for training\\nJewish \\nimmi-\\ngrants who would\\nestablish the in-\\ndustry in the\\ncountry.  This idea\\ncame up as early\\nas 1901, and in\\n1912 the Sultan\\ngave permission\\nto erect three\\nbuildings for the\\npurpose on Mount\\nCarmel, in Haifa.\\nThe institute was\\nfinally opened for\\n18 students in\\n1924 (2).\\nThese institutions were new\\nthen, and for the young geniuses they\\ncould not offer a promising scientific\\natmosphere built on a long tradition\\nand with well-equipped laboratories;\\nneither could the Daniel Sieff Re-\\nsearch Institute, the predecessor of the\\nWeizmann Institute.  It began its work\\nin 1934, but, as a visitor described,\\n“It was a small, isolated research out-\\npost, situated practically in the desert.\\nVisitors were lodged in a small club-\\nhouse attached to the Institute, and\\nduring the night they could hear the\\njackals howling in the nearby orange\\ngroves (3).”  This institute grew into\\na really large and significant scientific\\ncenter only after 1949, upon the foun-\\ndation of the Weizmann Institute.\\nAll the other higher education in-\\nstitutions and scientific centers are\\nmuch younger.  Bar-Ilan University\\nwas inaugurated in 1955, Tel Aviv University in 1956.\\nTeaching began in 1963 at Ben Gurion University, in\\nBeer Sheva, Negev;  but it was ceremonially opened\\nonly in 1969.  These could only give research and teach-\\ning opportunities for the postwar immigrants.\\nThe Hungarian-phenomenon Scientists in\\nIsrael\\nIsraeli condi-\\ntions before\\nthe \\nsecond\\nWorld \\nWar\\ncould compete\\nneither with\\nG e r m a n y ’s\\nlively scien-\\ntific life nor\\nwith the unlim-\\nited possibili-\\nties in the\\nUnited States.\\nStill, \\nsome\\neminent Hun-\\ngarian scien-\\ntists had very significant relations with Israel.\\nLeo Szilárd had been introduced to Weizmann, an\\nexcellent chemist before rising to become the head of\\nLeo Sziland, courtesy Oesper\\nCollection.\\nAlbert Szent-Gyorgyi, courtesy Oesper\\nCollection\\nGeorge vonHevesy, courtesy\\nOesper Collection\\nBull.

Michael Polányi, the\\nphysical chemist, later philosopher, suggested that\\nWeizmann consider Szilárd as a possible faculty mem-\\nber, when Weizmann was working hard on organizing a\\nphysics institute at the Hebrew University.  Polányi, di-\\nrecting one of the departments of the Kaiser Wilhelm\\nInstitut für Physikalische Chemie in Berlin/Dahlem,\\nformed an informal group around him consisting of well\\nknown young Hungarians.  The director of the institute\\nwas Fritz Haber, the Nobel laureate discoverer of the\\nammonia synthesis and for many reasons the leading\\npersonality of the German chemistry community, who\\ngreatly appreciated the whole group.  Haber, with an-\\nother classic figure of chemistry Richard Willstätter, also\\ntried to mediate between Szilárd and Weizmann; but,\\nfor unknown reasons, the effort did not succeed (4).\\nEugene Wigner, on the other hand, invited to visit\\nJerusalem in 1935, was offered the professorship of\\nphysics at the Hebrew University.  Unlike Szilárd,\\nWigner was inclined to accept the position but finally\\nrefused, because he felt he would lessen the chances of\\nhis close friend and colleague, Ladislaus Farkas, when\\nhe, Wigner, already had a post in the United States, and\\nFarkas had no other suitable opportunity.  Wigner paid\\nmany visits to Israel later, gave important talks, and par-\\nticipated in meetings, by which he contributed to the\\nnuclear physics of the country, including the work of\\nthe Dimona reactor in Negev (5).\\nEdward Teller’s involvement began in the 1960s\\nand has continued up until the present. His closest friend\\nand colleague, the nuclear physicist Yuval Ne’eman,\\ncooperated with him in many important matters con-\\ncerning the application of nuclear power to various en-\\ngineering goals, such as digging a canal through the\\ndesert.  Ne’eman characterized Teller’s Israeli role this\\nway (6):\\nEdward has met and talked at length with every Is-\\nraeli Prime Minister or Minister of Defence since\\n1966.\\nAs a committee member, he advised the experts on the\\ndefense technologies, nuclear reactor technologies, and\\nother related matters.  Teller was also of help to the larger\\nIsraeli scientific community.  He gave courses at Tel\\nAviv University and initiated the establishment of the\\nFaculty of Engineering there, the first dean of which\\nbecame Yuval Ne’eman.  For his contributions the\\nTechnion awarded Teller its Harvey Prize.  “Edward\\nTeller,” wrote Ne’eman, “has taken up his share in\\nIsrael’s worries—and has also brought Israel closer to\\nWestern values and closer to the USA (6).”  Besides\\nWigner and Teller, other Hungarian-phenomenon sci-\\nentists also visited Israel several times.  Kármán de-\\nscribed stories about his visits in his biography. Denis\\nGábor, Nobel laureate physicist, and Nicholas Kürti,\\nprofessor of physics in Oxford and fellow of the Royal\\nSociety, maintained their relations with, among others,\\nFerenc Körösy, professor of chemistry at Ben Gurion\\nUniversity (7).\\nThe First Hungarian Immigrant Scientists to\\nPalestine\\nDespite the unfavorable conditions in the early years,\\nsome very significant Hungarian scientists moved to\\nJerusalem to be\\npart of Hebrew\\nU n i v e r s i t y.\\nAmong the earli-\\nest professors\\nwas \\nMihály\\n(Moshe) Fekete\\n(1886-1957),\\none of the excep-\\ntionally creative\\nmathematicians\\nof his time, who,\\nwith his masters,\\nLipót Fejér and\\nManó \\nBeke,\\ngreatly contrib-\\nuted to the for-\\nmation of the\\nHungarian phe-\\nnomenon.  His\\nworks on the\\ntheory of num-\\nbers, theory of functions, and numeric sets made him a\\nwell known scientist while still quite young.  Besides\\nBudapest, Fekete studied in Göttingen, the center of\\nmathematics at that time.  After returning to Budapest\\nin 1914, he completed his Habilitation at Budapest Uni-\\nversity and gained an assistant position there, which he\\nsoon lost for political reasons.  In 1919 and 1920 totali-\\ntarian regimes of various colors followed each other,\\nand many great Hungarian scientists or their families\\nsuffered as a result.  As a gifted teacher, Fekete was\\nadvised to accept as a private student an especially tal-\\nented high school boy, because the level of this boy far\\nexceeded everything expected in a high school.  His\\nname was John von Neumann.  In this way, Fekete be-\\nEdward Teller, courtesy Oesper\\nCollection.\\n38\\nBull. Hist.

He\\nsoon adjusted to\\nthe new surround-\\nings there and be-\\ncame a most im-\\nportant personality in the university.  He imported to\\nIsrael the special Hungarian style of mathematics.  With\\nhis scientific and teaching abilities, he soon became a\\nprofessor in the Einstein Institute of Mathematics and\\ncontributed to the establishment of the faculty of sci-\\nence and to increasing opportunities for research in the\\nfield of natural sciences in general.  It was quite an ac-\\ncomplishment if one considers that in the university\\nfounders’ goal there was only “the glorious spiritual past\\ntraditions of Judaism, and the burning, irresistible de-\\nsire to revive them (8).”  Fekete and his fellow scien-\\ntists established an alliance with the head of the Aca-\\ndemic Council of the University, Chaim Weizmann.  For\\na while, Weizmann’s successor in the Academic Coun-\\ncil could be of help; he was Albert Einstein.  To be more\\neffective, Fekete worked as Dean of the Faculty of Sci-\\nence several times and became the Hebrew University’s\\nrector between 1945 and 1948.  Before his death in 1957,\\nhe was awarded the Israel Prize, the highest distinction\\nof the country (9).\\nThe Chemistry Clan: First Generation\\nThe Hungarian phenomenon in Israel was more evident\\nin chemistry than in mathematics.  Indeed, a news item\\nstated that Andor Fodor “…was the university’s first\\nteacher, and that he had been invited by Dr. Chaim\\nWeizmann to organize its Chemistry Institute, which\\nbecame the cornerstone on which the future Faculty of\\nScience was based (10).”\\nFodor was born in Budapest in 1884, graduated\\nfrom high school in Graz, and conducted his chemistry\\nstudies at the Budapest Technical University and ETH\\nin Zurich.  He began his scientific career as an organic\\nchemist there, then continued in Stockholm and Berlin.\\nFodor became Privatdozent in physiological chemistry\\nin Halle in 1919, then “…reached the conclusion that\\nthe situation of the Jews was such that they would be\\nforced to seek a secure refuge for themselves (11).”  He\\nbecame a Zionist and moved to Jerusalem in 1923, where\\nhe accomplished the pioneering work of establishing\\nmodern chemistry, including a building, at the opening\\nof the Hebrew University.  The very first classes in chem-\\nistry and many significant scientific results came from\\nFodor’s institute.  His memorable scientific activity\\nembraced various fields of organic chemistry, biochem-\\nistry, and colloid chemistry, for which he produced a\\nbook in 1925 (12).  However important Fodor’s activity\\nwas, he has been severely criticized for being overly\\nambitious.  He gained the reputation of exploiting his\\njunior associates as slaves, which poisoned the atmo-\\nsphere of the institute.  Weizmann definitely had to take\\nsome action.  In a letter Weizmann wrote, “The setting\\nup of a natural science faculty should begin immedi-\\nately.  This would, first of all, break the rule of the so-\\ncalled biological clique, Klinger [a biologist professor]—\\nFodor et tutti quanti (13).”\\nThis was a difficult period in the history of the uni-\\nversity because the leaders had to decide about the model\\nthey wanted to apply.  Einstein favored the German,\\nJudah Leon Magnes, the University Chancellor, the\\nAmerican model.  Einstein became disappointed in this\\ncontroversy and refused the professorship in the phys-\\nics institute.  Weizmann had to seek other scientists to\\noccupy the positions in the physics department (which\\nproved very difficult) and in the chemistry institute, to\\nbalance Fodor’s\\ninfluence.  Want-\\ning to employ a\\nphysical chemist,\\nhe chose another\\nH u n g a r i a n ,\\nL\\ná\\ns\\nz\\nl\\nó\\n( L a d i s l a u s )\\nFarkas.  “Person-\\nally I don’t know\\nhim at all.  But I\\nthink,” wrote\\nWeizmann, “he\\nis one of the best\\nyoung physico-\\nchemists, if not\\nthe best of them.\\nI know that Fritz\\nHaber has this\\nMichael Polanyi\\nJohn vonNeumann, courtesy Oesper\\nCollection.\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n39\\nopinion and so, I may say, had Rutherford (13).”  In\\nfact, they had already corresponded one year earlier,\\nwhen Farkas, on Szilárd’s suggestion, described his ideas\\nabout producing purified water.  At the end of his long\\nletter, Farkas wrote to Weizmann (14):\\nIch versichere Sie, falls mir Gelegenheit gegeben\\nwird, in Palästina zu arbeiten, dass ich meine ganze\\nKraft \\ndaran \\nsetzen \\nwerde \\nsowohl \\nin\\nwissenschaftlicher Hinsicht wie auch in der\\nBearbeitung technischer Probleme, die das Land\\nbetreffen, mein Bestes zu leisten (14).\\nLadislaus Farkas was born in Dunaszerdahely in 1904\\nand was two years older than his brother Adalbert, whose\\nlife and career run parallel (15).  They graduated from\\nhigh school in Hungary but became chemical engineers\\nin the Viennese Technische Hochschule; and then both\\nbegan to work in the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für\\nPhysikalische Chemie.  In 1928 the director of the insti-\\ntute, Fritz Haber, accepted Ladislaus as his personal as-\\nsistant.  By that time the Farkas brothers had done beau-\\ntiful work on ortho and para hydrogen and on deute-\\nrium, and they soon became well known experts on hy-\\ndrogen.  In the Berlin institute they became part of the\\ngroup of the Hungarian-phenomenon scientists around\\nMichael Polányi; and, because Wigner was Polányi’s\\ngraduate student, Ladislaus developed a lifelong friend-\\nship with him also (16).\\nThe Farkas brothers’ exceptionally promising ca-\\nreer was interrupted by the Nazis in 1933.  All the im-\\nportant people around them, Haber, Polányi, Wigner, and\\nSzilárd had to leave Germany.  Both Farkases found only\\ntemporary positions in Rutherford’s laboratory, then in\\nthe Institute of Colloid Chemistry in Cambridge; and,\\nalthough Szilárd and Polányi tried to help them, they\\nwere probably not happy with the positions finally\\nopened to them in English industry or at Bristol Univer-\\nsity (17).  Thus, Weizmann’s invitation to Ladislaus to\\nbecome a professor in Jerusalem could not have arrived\\nat a better time.  Zionism played no role in his immigra-\\ntion to Palestine (18).  Adalbert followed a year later in\\n1936 and remained until 1941, when, in spite of the major\\nefforts  by many scientists, including Albert Einstein,\\nhe could not receive more funds in the country (19).\\nWith his American wife, Adalbert settled in the United\\nStates, where he has continued to live.\\nIn the 1930s the brothers could continue their fruit-\\nful scientific investigations and participate in the life of\\nthe international scientific community.  The institute\\nworked well; it was rather well equipped and had a grow-\\ning number of graduate students.  Ladislaus proceeded\\nwith his hydro-\\ngen studies and\\nextended his\\ninterests to the\\nhydrocarbons.\\nAs they wanted\\nto contribute to\\nIsrael’s indus-\\ntry, they ex-\\npanded their re-\\nsearch subjects\\ntoward practi-\\ncal problems.\\nAdalbert, for\\ninstance, in-\\nvented a new\\ntype of wrap-\\nping paper to\\npreserve oranges during transportation.  Ladislaus was\\nappointed head of the Central Committee for the Devel-\\nopment of the Chemical Industry in Palestine in 1939.\\nThis proved particularly important during the war, when\\nthe institute produced glassware and chemicals needed\\nby the army and did research on the utilization of the\\ncountry’s raw materials, etc.  Farkas’ ingenious activity\\nreminds one of his Hungarian colleagues’ activities in\\nthe United States that were vital in developing the atomic\\nbomb.  He became the scientific secretary of the Scien-\\ntific Advisory Committee to the Palestine War Supply\\nBoard, just as Kármán, Szilárd, and Neumann partici-\\npated in similar committees in America (20).  After the\\nwar, Ladislaus Farkas made tremendous efforts to de-\\nvelop his institute by replacing old instruments and re-\\ndirecting research toward pure science.  He died in an\\nairplane crash in 1948, en route to purchase scientific\\ninstruments in the United States.\\nFarkas introduced modern physical chemistry to\\nIsrael, and he imported the Hungarian-phenomenon\\nmentality of working in the most competitive front line\\nof science and of applying the latest theoretical ap-\\nproaches.  He was part of this group.  One of his He-\\nbrew University graduates, Michael Szwartz, moved to\\nManchester to work with Polányi (21).  Polányi con-\\ntributed to the Farkas Memorial Volume edited by\\nAdalbert and Wigner (22).\\nThe Chemistry Clan: Second Generation\\nThe later developments of the physical chemistry de-\\npartment and of chemistry in Israel showed Farkas’ great\\nimpact.  After his accident, the leaders of the university\\nEugene Wigner, courtesy\\nOesper Collection.\\n40\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\napproached Adalbert to occupy his brother’s vacated\\nchair.  This seemed an obvious solution, and Adalbert\\nconsidered it seriously, but finally decided against it,\\nsaying that he had built up a new existence and home in\\nthe US (23).\\nThe new permanent head, and real successor, was\\nalso an Hungarian and former student of Farkas: Gabriel\\nStein, born in Budapest in 1920.  After graduating from\\na Budapest “Realgymnasium,” he immigrated to Pales-\\ntine in 1938 and received his masters degree as Ladislaus\\nFarkas’ student.  He earned his Ph.D. under another\\nformer Haber student, Joseph Weiss, in Durham, En-\\ngland, where Stein remained until 1951 (24).  Then he\\nreturned to Jerusalem and joined the department of physi-\\ncal chemistry, where he soon became head.  Gabriel Stein\\nled the department back to the direction set by Farkas\\nand elevated the scientific level to its former height. It\\nis also Stein’s achievement that two of his students,\\nJoshua Jortner and Raphael B. Levine, became two of\\nthe most prominent physical chemists of the country\\n(25).\\nIn the early 1970s, the Hebrew University chemis-\\ntry departments were reorganized, and as a result a ma-\\njor institute was set up.  This time another Hungarian\\nwas appointed the head of the institute:  Saul Patai, edi-\\ntor of the book series The Chemistry of Functional\\nGroups, comprising 100 volumes.  The Patai family\\nimmigrated to Palestine in 1938, as traditional Zionists.\\nRaphael Patai, Saul’s brother, who died recently, was a\\nfamous cultural anthropologist and linguist. One of his\\nlast works was the book, The Jewish Alchemists.  Their\\nfather, President of the Pro Palestine Association, had\\nvisited Palestine many times before the family settled\\nthere.  Saul, born in Budapest in 1918, attended the uni-\\nversity in Budapest for two years and then became a\\nstudent of Andor Fodor;  but he received his masters\\ndegree under Ladislaus Farkas in 1941.  In his main re-\\nsearch fields—the mechanism of organic reactions, the\\nreactions of olefins, and the chemical reactions in solid\\nstate—he achieved important scientific results. Patai, like\\nmany other prominent Hungarians, contributed to de-\\nfense-related research; after the Yom Kippur War, he\\norganized a research group devoted to such subjects (26).\\nHe died in 1998.\\nThe Chemistry Clan: Third Generation\\nThe third generation of Hungarian chemists arrived in\\nIsrael after the 1956 Hungarian revolution.  Its two out-\\nstanding personalities are Ferenc Körösy and Ruben\\nPauncz, both foreign members of the Hungarian Acad-\\nemy of Sciences, and neither of them associated with\\nHebrew University.  Both began to work at the Technion,\\nbut Körösy, contrary to his own wishes, soon moved to\\nBeer-Sheva.  They were not the first Hungarians at the\\nTechnion.  In addition to several engineers (P.W. Ernst,\\nA. Gileadi, B. Kinori, M. Vajda) and the famous math-\\nematician Paul Erdos, who never lived permanently any-\\nwhere, but regularly taught at the Technion as a visiting\\nprofessor (27), they also met at the university Shlomo\\nBien, a former graduate student of Géza Zemplén’s fa-\\nmous organic chemistry school at Budapest Technical\\nUniversity (28).\\nFerenc Körösy, born in Budapest in 1906, also be-\\nlonged to the group of the Hungarian-phenomenon sci-\\nentists and was in contact with many of them.  Teller,\\nhis old friend, was his classmate at the university in\\nKarlsruhe.  While Teller changed to physics, Körösy\\ncontinued as a chemist and returned to Budapest to oc-\\ncupy a position in the laboratory of the Tungsram fac-\\ntory, probably the only high tech plant in Hungary in\\nthe period between the wars.  As a result, he was in-\\nvolved in the research and development of the krypton\\nbulb, the greatest innovation of the factory.  This labo-\\nratory employed many of the best scientists of the time,\\nincluding Michael Polányi, who was living permanently\\nin Manchester, and for a shorter period even Denis Gábor\\nand Edward Teller.\\nThe Körösy family had a long Zionist tradition, the\\nreason why Ferenc Körösy decided to move to Israel.\\nBy 1957, however, when he could realize his plan, he\\nwas over fifty; and it was not easy to begin a new ca-\\nreer.  Nevertheless, he worked on very important projects\\nin Israel, mostly in inorganic chemistry, and found sat-\\nisfaction with his new life (29).\\nRuben Pauncz, born in 1920, achieved immediate\\nsuccess upon his arrival in Israel.  In Hungary, working\\nat Szeged University, he was the first scientist engaged\\nin quantum chemistry in that country.  In Israel, as the\\nTechnion chemistry faculty was modernizing the cur-\\nriculum in the middle 1950s, Pauncz was instrumental\\nin introducing quantum chemistry.  As a result, right after\\nhis arrival in 1957, he was able to begin teaching and\\ncould continue his productive research work on, among\\nother things, the application of the quantum chemistry\\nmethods to alternate hydrocarbons, in cooperation with\\nhis colleagues in Uppsala and Florida.  He published\\nfour books in English on quantum chemistry.  In this\\nway, Pauncz fits into the long series of Hungarian sci-\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n41\\nentists who contributed to the knowledge transfer into\\nIsrael.  Although he never belonged to a specific scien-\\ntific school, since he was self taught in the new disci-\\npline,  Pauncz brought his knowledge with him from\\nSzeged.  This is how he also became the first quantum\\nchemist in Israel, his second home.  Endowed with ex-\\nceptional teaching abilities and recognized as a most\\npopular professor of the university, Pauncz trained gen-\\nerations of gifted quantum chemists, who by now have\\nestablished a lively professional community at the\\nTechnion (30).\\nConclusions\\nWithout surveying the entire, long list of Hungarian sci-\\nentists, one can conclude that, in fact,  there existed a\\nHungarian phenomenon in Israel.  It would also be worth\\ninvestigating the history of Hungarian social scientists,\\nincluding Joshua Blau, a Hebrew and Arabic linguist\\nand the only Hungarian member of the exclusive Israeli\\nAcademy of Science, or Joseph Ben-David, an excel-\\nlent sociologist, formerly a chemist, who exerted a great\\nimpact on the sociology of science not only in Israel but\\nthroughout the world.  However, on the basis of the\\nanalysis of only the most significant cases of natural\\nscientists, some important features of the Israeli Hun-\\ngarian phenomenon have been identified.  1)  Quite a\\nfew Hungarian scientists settled in Israel, and many were\\nin close contact with the most famous ones. They can\\nbe considered a part of the Hungarian-phenomenon\\ngroup, or perhaps an Israeli extension of it.  Even some\\nof the greatest Hungarian scientists had direct or indi-\\nrect involvement in Israeli science.  2) Unlike in the US,\\nwhere the physicists had the most eminent roles, in Is-\\nrael the chemists became the most successful.  3) Zion-\\nism often played a part in their migration to Israel, but\\nthis Zionism was positive in the sense that it was a stance\\nfor Israel and not against Hungary.  4) Some character-\\nistic features of the Hungarian scientists became evi-\\ndent:  their modern theoretical approach and a frequent\\ncombination of this theoretical inclination with a prac-\\ntical orientation.  These features, in an atmosphere of\\nspecial political awareness, resulted in success in the\\nmilitary-related fields.  5) The Hungarians contributed\\nto the knowledge transfer into Israel in two ways.  First,\\nthey represented the most advanced level of their scien-\\ntific field; and, second, they brought with them the fer-\\ntile Hungarian culture and middle-class life style.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nI would like to express my gratitude to the European\\nCommittee of the Weizmann Institute and for the OTKA\\n1994 T 017964 for supporting my research.

Bailey trained thousands of chemists and helped\\nestablish a strong, dynamic Chemistry Department. He\\ndedicated his life to educating Kansans about the need\\nfor clean water, proper labeling, and unadulterated\\nfoods.  His many publications,\\nanalyses of industrial products,\\ndesire to educate, and leader-\\nship in the Kansas State Board\\nof Health brought national rec-\\nognition to the University of\\nKansas Chemistry Department\\n(1).\\nScientific developments in\\nthe nineteenth century began to\\nrevolutionize chemistry. Ad-\\nvances in bacteriology and the\\ninvention of the achromatic mi-\\ncroscope in the 1830s brought\\nabout the first serious labora-\\ntory testing and analysis of\\nwater, milk, and foods. The\\nnumber of laboratories in\\nmedical schools, universities,\\nhealth departments, and hospi-\\ntals increased. Many new sci-\\nentific publications began to\\nappear. In January 1879 in an\\naddress to the Medical Society\\nof New York, Edward\\nRobinson Squibb, a pharmacologist and pioneer in an-\\nesthesia, proposed a national statute to regulate food and\\ndrugs. He convinced Senator Warner Miller of New York\\nState to introduce such a bill on December 20, 1881, to\\nthe Forty-seventh Congress of the United States, but it\\nwas defeated by a group of\\nprosperous manufacturers of\\npatent medicines who lob-\\nbied against the bill. Squibb\\ndied before he could see his\\ndream come to fruition.\\nTwenty-five years later, such\\na law was passed by the\\nUnited States Congress as the\\nFederal Pure Food and Drugs\\nAct of 1906 (2).\\nDuring these times of\\nimportant advances in sci-\\nence and technology, Edgar\\nHenry Summerfield Bailey\\nwas born on September 17,\\n1848, in the manufacturing\\nvillage of Baileyville, near\\nMiddlefield, Connecticut. He\\nwas the only son of Russell\\nE. and Hannah Miller Bailey.\\nRussell owned a machine\\nshop that made wooden cof-\\nfee mill handles for a hard-\\nware factory, later turning out\\nTHE CONTRIBUTIONS OF E.

The son grew up in\\nthis environment, building machinery, mill dams, and\\nwater wheels. After he completed education at the dis-\\ntrict school, he attended the Wesleyan Academy in\\nWilbraham, Massachusetts, where he became especially\\ninterested in chemistry, physics, and geology (3).  After\\nWesleyan he attended the Sheffield Scientific School at\\nYale University from which he received a bachelor’s\\ndegree in 1873.  He spent another year at Yale doing\\ngraduate study and teaching before assuming his first\\nfull-time teaching position at Lehigh University in\\nBethlehem, Pennsylvania, at an annual salary of $1,000.\\nAlong with his teaching, Bailey performed commercial\\nwork, analyzing iron, zinc, and manganese ores, coal,\\nlimestone, furnace gas, and other industrial products.\\nHe remained at Lehigh for nine years, gaining experi-\\nence in performing commercial chemical analyses and\\npreparing himself to teach mineralogy, metallurgy, and\\nassaying (4).\\nFollowing the American pattern at the time, Bailey\\nstudied in Europe at the Kaiser Wilhelm University at\\nStraßburg  under Dr. Rudolph Fittig (5).   In 1883 he\\nreceived the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Illi-\\nnois Wesleyan University (6) and became head of the\\nUniversity of Kansas Chemistry Department.  He ar-\\nrived in Lawrence when it was a town of board walk-\\nways, mud roads, and community drinking cups.  Dis-\\nease was widespread; contaminated food was common,\\nand drinking waters often were polluted. During the next\\nfifty years of teaching and research, he helped bring\\nhealthy food and safe drinking water to the people of\\nKansas.\\nBailey’s meager laboratory was in the basement of\\nFraser Hall, one of only two buildings on the campus.\\nThe entire chemistry library consisted of 22 of his own\\nbooks. As the only teacher in his department he had no\\nassistance other than what the more advanced students\\nwere able to give.  He taught a remarkable spread of\\nsubjects, including general chemistry, qualitative chem-\\nistry, quantitative chemistry, organic chemistry, assay-\\ning, mineralogy, metallurgy, blowpipe analysis, toxicol-\\nogy, physiological chemistry, and materia medica.  In\\n1885, perhaps out of sheer enthusiasm, he added a course\\nin domestic and sanitary chemistry. The University of\\nKansas thus became one of the first universities to offer\\na course in the practical applications of chemical prin-\\nciples to everyday life. This led to the establishment of\\nthe Department of Home Economics and to Bailey’s\\nwriting one of the first textbooks in the field in 1914:\\nThe Source, Chemistry and Use of Food Products (7).\\nAfter the Federal Pure Food and Drug Act was\\npassed in 1906, Bailey began to press for such an act in\\nthe state of Kansas. He sent the first food analysis to the\\nState Board of Health in January 1906 (8), in which he\\nreported that two-thirds of the food analyzed contained\\npreservatives and adulterants. The report was copied\\nUniversity of Kansas Chemistry Laboratory\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n45\\nwidely by the press and caused a sensation throughout\\nthe state.  It was also met with opposition, especially\\nfrom the owners of the packinghouses.  For example,\\nwhen sausages were examined and reported to be artifi-\\ncially colored and to contain a preservative, the attor-\\nney for the packinghouse complained to Governor Ed-\\nward W. Hoch that the packing house was being ruined\\nsince people quit buying its sausages.  Politicians and\\nlawyers tried to bribe the Board of Health staff to look\\nthe other way when inspecting their meat products.  In\\nspite of the pressures, the governor supported the State\\nBoard of Health and, on the basis of previous work at\\nthe Chemistry Department, the Kansas Pure Food and\\nDrug Act was passed on February l4, l907 (9).\\nEnforcement of this law was placed in the hands of\\nthe State Board of Health which delegated the examina-\\ntion of foods and drugs to Julius T. Willard at the Kan-\\nsas State Agricultural College in Manhattan and to Bailey\\nat the University of Kansas Chemical Laboratory.  The\\nlatter facility became known as the State Food Labora-\\ntory (10).  Under the auspices of the state board, sec-\\ntional meetings were held throughout the state for the\\npurpose of educating everyone whose business related\\nto the Kansas Pure Food and Drug Act.  The committee\\nchairing these meetings consisted of Bailey, Lucius E.\\nSayre of the Pharmacy Department at the University of\\nKansas, Willard, and Samuel J.Crumbine, the state health\\nofficer.  During one of these meetings, Bailey listed the\\nfollowing examples of the most commonly adulterated\\nfoods in Kansas (11):\\nFlour bleached by an electrical process; sugar whit-\\nened with bluing; butter mixed with too much water;\\npickles hardened with alum; pure cider vinegar made\\nof a malt substance and colored with burnt sugar;\\nlemon extract made of diluted alcohol passed through\\nthe shadow of a lemon and colored with coal tar yel-\\nlow; vanilla extract made of artificial substances, col-\\nored with burnt sugar and flavored with prune juice;\\nspices from which the essential oils have been re-\\nmoved; meat that has been artificially preserved with\\nsulphites and brightened in appearance; and tomato\\ncatsup artificially colored and preserved.\\nKeeping food safe was not an easy task, since manufac-\\nturers were trying to cut costs, often by slipping cheap\\nsubstitutions into foods. To do its work, the State Food\\nLaboratory purchased products to analyze. These prod-\\nucts, their manufacturers, and the chemist’s findings\\nwere listed in the newspapers.  A report on the Primrose\\nExtract of banana was typical (12):\\nPrimrose Flavoring Extract of Banana, Manufactur-\\ning Department of Parkhurst-Davis Mercantile Com-\\npany, Topeka, Kan. Amount contained in bottle, 50\\ngrams, or 1.8 fluid ounces. This contained 28.6 per\\ncent of alcohol, by weight; artificial flavoring, 16.5\\nper cent, by volume; coloring material, a coal-tar dye.\\nAs it is not practical to make a concentrated extract\\nof banana, there seems to be no objection to the sale\\nof an artificial preparation like this.  It should not be\\nlabeled Extract of Banana, however, but Artificial\\nBanana Flavoring. Compound ethers are very often\\nused in making these so-called “pure-fruit flavors.”\\nThe materials should be sold upon their merits and\\nnot under an assumed name, for there is usually no\\nfruit used in their preparation.\\nBailey’s findings revealed many forms of adulteration.\\nHe found that copper had been added to canned veg-\\netables to produce a natural-looking green color. A com-\\nmercial sausage had a large amount of starch added to\\nallow the use of more fat or water. Jams and jellies, made\\nfrom treated cider mill refuse, proclaimed Bailey (13):\\n..had their compositions so exposed that if they had\\nnot been already as red as aniline colors could make\\nthem, they would have blushed to acknowledge that\\nno fruit whatever had been used in their manufac-\\nture.\\nLead chromate was put into lemon drops; burnt sienna,\\na mineral substance, was used to imitate chocolate; but-\\nter and cheese were colored to appear golden. Bailey\\nhoped this practice of coloring food to make it attrac-\\ntive would be eliminated, saying, “A dyed food like a\\nmade-up complexion will cease to be admired (14).”\\nThe State Food Laboratory also examined the pu-\\nrity of grains.  Because the bleaching of flour could cover\\nup many imperfections, Bailey suggested the public\\ncould avoid eating unwholesome or musty flour by us-\\n46\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\ning unbleached flour.  The public’s preference for white\\nbread over dark bread dated back to the time when a\\ncheaper bread was made from rye flour or badly milled\\nwheat flour that was only bought by the poor.  Because\\nthe bleached flour was white, it was thought to be pure.\\nInstead of purifying the flour by bleaching with nitro-\\ngen dioxide, however, this process rendered the flour so\\nantiseptic that it resisted the digestive juices and thus\\nwas unhealthy. The consumer now wants (15):\\n..nice, white bread to set before her guests. It doesn’t\\nmatter that this flour is usually bleached by chemi-\\ncals, just as much as your straw hat is bleached by\\nsulfur fumes, and your sheeting is bleached by chlo-\\nride of lime in the bleachery.\\nTo make the public aware of these adulterations Bailey\\nbegan publishing pamphlets and writing articles for the\\nnewspapers.  One such pamphlet, “Some Simple Kitchen\\nTests to Detect the Adulteration of Foods,” was distrib-\\nuted throughout the state.  Anyone could perform these\\nsimple tests, and the pamphlet was popular with house-\\nwives who kept it handy in the kitchen drawer. He wrote\\narticles in the Topeka Daily Capital under a column\\ncalled “Sanitary Suggestions” with such titles as “What\\nWater Shall We Drink?” and “The Art of Coloring Food\\n(16).”\\nThe size of cans and containers for foods was a\\nconcern handled by the State Food Laboratory.  When a\\nweights and measures law was passed in 1911, its en-\\nforcement was delegated to the State Board of Health.\\nBailey tried to teach people to be aware of both the con-\\ntent and weight of the food they bought (17):\\nPound packages originally contained sixteen ounces,\\nand quart cans held two pints; but the commercial\\nconscience slept, and while it slept the thrifty manu-\\nfacturer, in order to further increase his profits,\\ntrimmed off an ounce here, and half a gill there.\\nFood in state institutions was also under the jurisdiction\\nof the State Board of Health, and often it was found to\\nbe of poor quality and lacking nutritional value.  Since\\nBailey was chemist for the State Board of Health he\\ntried to improve the situation by making dietary studies\\nof such institutions as the Kansas State Penitentiary in\\nLansing, the State Industrial Reformatory in Hutchinson,\\nthe Osawatomie State Hospital, and the Girls’ Indus-\\ntrial School in Beloit.  He was also called upon from\\ntime to time to testify in court trials concerning poisons\\nand drugs.   At one such trial the defendant had suppos-\\nedly disposed of his wife with poisoned chocolates.\\nWhen Bailey declared the chocolates untainted, the judge\\nasked where they were.  Bailey replied that he had eaten\\nthem (18).\\nIn addition to Bailey’s work to protect the public\\nfrom fraud and impure food, he was concerned about\\nthe state’s water. When in 1889 the Kansas Legislature\\nauthorized The University of Kansas to undertake “a\\ncomplete geological survey of such portions of the state\\nof Kansas as have any natural products of economic\\nimportance,” Bailey was an obvious leader for the re-\\nsulting Kansas Geological Survey, in partnership with\\nErasmus Haworth (physical geology and mineralogy)\\nand Samuel Williston (paleontology) (19).  Between\\n1898 and 1908 this trio of scientists wrote The Univer-\\nsity Geological Survey of Kansas. This nine-volume\\nwork included their explorations on Kansas’ paleonto-\\nlogical sites, coal, gypsum, mineral waters, oil, gas, lead,\\nand zinc. Bailey’s primary contribution to this survey\\nwas an analysis of the state’s mineral waters, which in-\\ncludes descriptions of and notes about the resorts, bath\\nhouses, and hotels built around the mineral springs.  He\\ndescribed the Great Spirit Spring in Mitchell County that\\nthe Indians had always regarded as sacred.  It was un-\\nusual in that it did not flow like a spring but rose from a\\nmound of stone, seldom overflowing, and seeped back\\ninto the surrounding porous rock.  He commented on\\nthe large bathhouse and hotel built in Geuda Springs\\nwhere the Geuda Springs Town and Water Company\\nbottled water for sale, along with lemon sour, ginger\\nale, and other carbonated beverages.  He noted that the\\nflow from one of the largest springs in the state at Sun\\nSprings in Brown County was estimated to be 5,000 gal-\\nlons an hour. He also mentioned the sanitarium at Bonner\\nSprings, Wyandotte County built around the springs for\\nthe treatment of mental and nervous disorders (20).  As\\nthe cities became more populated, the danger of infec-\\ntion from the wells by surface drainage increased. In a\\ntown on the Smoky Hill River it was suspected that a\\ncesspool was polluting a well about 150 feet away.  To\\ndetermine whether this was correct, a solution of iron\\nsulfate was put into the cesspool, and in about 48 hours\\nthe residents tasted the bitter iron. Chemical analysis of\\nthe well water proved that the users were drinking their\\nneighbor’s diluted sewage.  Another example of this type\\nof pollution occurred at the beet sugar plant in Garden\\nCity where the used pulp was thrown out on the ground\\nand allowed to ferment and decompose. These instances\\nprompted a warning from Bailey and Bartow (21):\\nShallow wells or springs in densely populated areas\\nor in loose, porous soil, or near a known source of\\npollution, should always be tested. To conclude that\\njust because water is bright, clear and sparkling makes\\nit safe to drink is dangerous because the very gases\\nof decomposition may make the water look sparkly.\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n47\\nThe mining industry was another cause of river pollu-\\ntion.  An analysis of the run off waters showed large\\nquantities of iron sulfate and sulfuric acid, which pre-\\nvented the survival of fish (22).\\nThe best source of drinking water, said Bailey, was\\na city water and sewage plant, where the whole quantity\\ncould be supervised carefully and analyzed frequently.\\nThe first such plant was built in Lawrence in 1886, with\\nthe Kansas (Kaw) River as its supply.  Rainwaters fall-\\ning off the roofs into cisterns or reservoirs were\\nrecommended in the rural areas as safe if they were ob-\\ntained from a well-painted shingle roof where the first\\nrun-off had been discarded so as to wash the roof thor-\\noughly.  But boiling water was the safest way to free it\\nof contamination (23).\\nSoutheastern Kansas and southwestern Missouri\\nwere of great economic importance because of their lead\\nand zinc mines, which yielded in 1909 about 9% of the\\ntotal lead output and almost 50% of the total zinc output\\nof the United States.  Bailey’s chemistry department was\\nan important location for the training of analysts and\\nmineralogists for the coal and metal ore mining indus-\\ntries, as well as for the oil and gas industries.  He car-\\nried out the first analysis of Kansas oil and natural gas,\\nthe forerunner of the helium industry (24).  Hamilton\\nCady, who succeeded Bailey as head of the Chemistry\\nDepartment, cited an example of his wide influence as a\\ntechnologist in an address (25):\\nA shipment came [to the laboratories] from Utah of a\\npeculiar mineral, alunite. This mineral, after being\\nheated, would partly dissolve in water, and from the\\nsolution alum could be crystallized. Some years later,\\nI saw an unusual mine operation in south-eastern\\nUtah, and upon inquiring I found they were alunite\\nmines, being worked by the same process Bailey had\\nsuggested. A Bailey industry way out there in Utah.\\nDuring the fifty years of Bailey’s tenure at the Univer-\\nsity of Kansas (1883-1933), his students made impor-\\ntant contributions to the development of the industrial\\nresources of the state. Some went into the\\nzinc and lead mining industries in the south-\\neastern part of the state. Others were em-\\nployed by the gas, oil, and glass industries,\\nas well as in the short-lived sorghum in-\\ndustry at Medicine Lodge, Topeka, Ottawa,\\nand Fort Scott.  The smelters, oil refiner-\\nies, soap factories, and packing plants at\\nKansas City, St. Joseph, and Omaha hired\\nmany Kansas chemists.  In this manner,\\nchemists played an important role in im-\\nproving the lives of Kansans.  Bailey never\\nwavered in his crusade to safeguard the\\npublic against impure and injurious foods\\nand to protect them from the frauds of\\nmislabeling and misbranding. He believed\\nthat the public’s good health could be main-\\ntained through knowledge gained from the\\nchemist’s experiments, and he devoted his\\nlife to sharing this knowledge with the\\npeople of Kansas (26).\\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\\nl.\\nFrom classes conducted by Bailey went young people\\nwho became leaders in scientific research in this coun-\\ntry: H.

The program was patterned after the ones al-\\nready in effect in several British Universities, Oxford,\\nCambridge, and University of London.  The purpose was\\nto fill an urgent and legitimate need on the part of many\\nmature individuals throughout the United States who\\ndesired to further their education but were unable to leave\\ntheir current employment.  In 1882 when Professor\\nBailey received his doctoral degree, Prof. C. M. Moss\\nwas Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and also direc-\\ntor of the nonresident work.  Branches of this depart-\\nment were established in both Canada and England.  A\\ntotal of 750 students finished their degrees in this pro-\\ngram between 1881 and 1890, reaching a high point in\\n1900/1901 when 478 were enrolled.

Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nIntroduction\\nThe term “alchemy” encompasses a broad spectrum of\\nactivities that appeared in the Hellenistic world in the\\nfirst centuries of our era and then, through Arabic me-\\ndiation, reached Latin Europe by the mid 12thcentury.\\nOut of numerous attempts to define this science, that\\nproposed by Sheppard (1) appears the most suitable be-\\ncause it includes the two main goals of alchemy: the\\nenhancement of matter and the improvement of human\\nexistence. Concerning the former, it should be achieved\\nby the transmutation of base metals into precious ones,\\nwhile the second main direction strove for improvement\\nof humans by extending their life, the further stage of\\nwhich was seen as attaining a higher spiritual level.\\nSheppard’s definition marks off both extreme limits,\\nencompassing everything that can be included in al-\\nchemy; in reality, the spectrum of various alchemical\\nactivities was a continuum, situated between both ex-\\ntremes.\\nAlchemists continued their efforts surprisingly long\\nin Europe, in spite of the failure of alchemy to fulfill its\\npromises. The ultimate decline is observed here as late\\nas the 18th century, but scholarly works defending this\\nscience appeared even in the beginning of the following\\ncentury (2).  A statistical approach (3) to alchemical lit-\\nerature is revealing: at least two, if not three, marked\\nflourishes of alchemy occurred between the introduc-\\ntion of book printing and 1800. One is apparent in the\\nsecond half of the 16th century, the second one in the\\nbeginning of the 17th century and, eventually a third one\\nfollowed the Thirty Years War. German titles represent\\none third out of all alchemical books that appeared over\\nthe whole studied period (4). This is a witness of the\\nlive interest paid to alchemy in Central Europe; the\\nmajority of these books are still awaiting scholarly re-\\nsearch.\\nAlchemical literature underwent gradual change,\\nbeing at the beginning often theoretical explanations of\\nthe composition of matter and recipes for the prepara-\\ntion of philosopher’s stone, elixirs, etc.  Yet none of these\\nmiracles was effected; no true transmutation of metals\\nsucceeded.  An example of the fate of alchemical claims\\nto cure all illnesses was their failure during epidemics\\nof plague that broke out in Europe by the mid 14th cen-\\ntury.  As a result of this continuous series of failures,\\ndefenses of alchemy began to appear. Well-known are\\nshort testimonies of such recognized personalities as\\nHelvetius or van Helmont (5), but even entire books were\\nwritten with the same intent:  to testify that transmuta-\\ntion is a real and feasible process.  This kind of alchemi-\\ncal work, particularly common in the 17th and 18th cen-\\nturies, can be roughly divided into two main groups. In\\nthe first, the author compiled important ideas from older\\nsources, as did Kelley in his treatise (6), to mention a\\ntypical example.  In the second, the author collected sto-\\nries about successful transmutations to prove the truth\\nof his claims, while also including a thorough and pen-\\netrating analysis of alchemy. The book Die Edelgeborne\\nJungfer Alchymia discussed in the present paper belongs\\nto the second group.  Familiar with arguments in oppo-\\nsition to alchemy, its author led a polemic against them;\\nDIE EDELGEBORNE JUNGFER ALCHYMIA:\\nTHE FINAL STAGE OF EUROPEAN ALCHEMY\\nVladimír Karpenko, Charles University, Czech Republic\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n51\\nthus, this book is not only a passive description of al-\\nleged successes, but an active explanation of alchemy\\nas a science; hence, Die Edelgeborne Jungfer Alchymia\\nis an extraordinary work in late European alchemy.\\nThis book appeared in\\n1730, too late to exert signifi-\\ncant influence on science in\\ngeneral and alchemy in par-\\nticular. By then new chemi-\\ncal discoveries, including the\\nfirst known chemical ele-\\nments (cobalt, 1737/8; nickel,\\n1751), had changed the scene\\n(7).  Moreover, the relatively\\nhigh number of alchemical\\nbooks still in print at that time\\nproduced an informational\\nnoise \\nin \\nwhich \\nDie\\nEdelgeborne \\nJungfer\\nAlchymia was lost (8). Yet this\\nbook of limited influence on\\nthe 18th century scientists is of\\ninterest to present scholars for\\nthe following reasons.  It is an\\nillustration of the state of late\\nalchemy, written by a practic-\\ning, erudite alchemist. Some\\nof his descriptions of experi-\\nments reflect doubts as to the\\npossibility of transmutation,\\nwhich had developed even\\namong believers like himself.\\nIn defense of alchemy, key ar-\\nguments of its opponents are\\nsummarized, and the attempts\\nof the author to disprove them reflect the alchemical\\nway of thinking.  It is one of a large collection of al-\\nchemical stories.  In the present work, important details\\nof this book will be discussed within the broader frame-\\nwork of alchemy in general and its late European stage\\nin particular.\\nThe Book and the Author\\nThe history of this book is quite extraordinary, and its\\norigin is still not explained completely. Originally, there\\nappeared an anonymous, 424-page book entitled Die\\nEdelgeborne Jungfer Alchymia (9) [referred to hereaf-\\nter as Die Edelgeborne], dated 1730. In this same year,\\nthe identical German text was published by Samuel\\nRoth-Scholz under a different title, Ehren-Rettung der\\nAlchemie (10).  Ferguson (11), analyzing the origin of\\nthis book, found yet a third, identical  version from the\\nsame year, entitled V.F.S.P. Edelgeborne Jungfer\\nAlchymia (12).  Further search-\\ning led him to conclude that the\\nauthor was J. C. Creiling (13),\\nand that the manuscript which\\nappeared simultaneously under\\nthree different titles was com-\\npleted as early as 1717.  The\\ntitle page and list of contents\\nwere included in Roth-Scholz’s\\nBibliotheca Chemica.  In\\nFerguson’s opinion, the title\\nEhren-Rettung der Alchemie\\nmust have been withdrawn or\\ncanceled almost immediately,\\nbecause copies bearing this title\\nare extremely rare.  Creiling’s\\nauthorship was confirmed by\\nFrick (14), who rediscovered\\nthe manuscript mentioned by\\nRoth-Scholz in the archives of\\nBochum, Germany.  This\\nmanuscript had been presented\\nto Carl Arnold Kortum (1745 -\\n1824) by Creiling’s daughter-\\nin-law in 1784.  Kortum con-\\nfirmed that it was that one\\nwhich appeared as Ehren-\\nRettung der Alchemie. No ex-\\nplanation has been found  as to\\nwhy this book appeared under\\nthe name Die Edelgeborne, not\\nto mention its third title.  According to Ferguson, all\\nthree books are identical.\\nJohann Konrad Creiling (born July 9, 1673,\\nLöchgau, Württemberg; died September 13, 1752,\\nTübingen) was a talented son of a parish priest.  He stud-\\nied theology, history, anatomy, botany, and mathemat-\\nics at the Tübingische Seminarium, where he obtained\\nthe degree “eines Magisters der Weltweisheit” in 1692.\\nHe then pursued mathematics, studying in Basel with\\nBernoulli, in Paris with l’Hôpital and de la Hire, and\\nwith other scientists.  Creiling then spent 44 years as a\\nprofessor of natural science [Naturlehre] and geometry\\n[Meßkunst] at the University of Tübingen.  According\\nto Kortum, Creiling was an extraordinarily learned man\\nwith a deep interest in “der Höheren Chemie,” alchemy.\\nHe employed several assistants in his private laboratory,\\nTitle page\\n52\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nand kept a detailed diary between 1737 and 1751, a re-\\nsource Frick did not find in the Bochum archive.\\nFerguson also cites Creiling’s further works on math-\\nematics (15) and alchemy (16).\\nCreiling explains his reason for writing this book\\nin the preface.  As a young scholar studying nature, he\\ncame across processes concerning changes in metals.\\nIn his search for experts in this field he found some, but\\nthey turned out to be swindlers.  Later he met “a doc-\\ntor,” almost 80 years old, said to be a “master,” who\\naccepted Creiling as his “filius artis;” but after fifteen\\nyears it became evident that he also was a fraudulent\\nalchemist.  Disappointed by this experience, Creiling\\ndecided to search independently for cases of successful\\ntransmutation and to study original alchemical litera-\\nture.  This narration is a classical alchemical story in-\\nvolving an anonymous master, who, having donated the\\nphilosopher’s stone and presided over successful trans-\\nmutations, disappeared, leaving no traces (17).  Later,\\nwhen the fortunate adept had used up his precious gift,\\nhe was at a loss because he did not know the recipe.  An\\nexceptional example is the attempt by the alchemist von\\nRichthausen to solve this problem when he had depleted\\nhis supply of the tincture, allegedly received from a\\nstranger. An announcement was officially published\\nseeking the unknown master.  Should the producer of\\nthis miraculous substance appear before the court of\\nAustrian Emperor Ferdinand III (1608 - 1657), he was\\npromised a reward of 100,000 thalers (18).  Creiling’s\\nversion of his study of alchemy is a typical account in\\nwhich both mysterious teachers and impostors appear.\\nAs is apparent from the second mentioned title of\\nCreiling’s book [Die Ehren-Rettung], it was written in\\ndefense of a science that “was given to people, as a gift\\nfrom God  and a celestial wisdom under the disdainful\\nname alchemy.”  The intention to purge alchemy of its\\nbad image apparently led the author to symbolize it as\\nan innocent virgin. This symbol was widely used in al-\\nchemy: the assumption and coronation of the Virgin were\\nunderstood as the glorification of matter (19); and, as\\npointed out by Gebelein (20), St. Mary was identified\\nsometimes with Sophia, the personification of wisdom.\\nDistillation, a process so crucial in alchemy, was given\\nthe sign of the Virgin (21).  It may be significant that the\\nword “alchemy,” die Alchemie, is feminine in the Ger-\\nman language.\\nThe Contents of the Book\\nDie Edelgeborne is divided into five chapters:\\nI.  Ob die Verwandlung der Metallen möglich seye?\\n(Whether a change of metals is possible?); pp 1 - 19).\\nThis chapter is devoted to the most common objections\\nagainst alchemy. Their rejection by the author illustrates\\nthe typical argumentation of alchemists.\\nII. Ob die Verwandlung der Metallen irgendwo\\nwürcklich geschehen? (Whether a change of metals has\\nreally happened anywhere?); pp 20 - 306. Among the\\ncharacteristic arguments alchemists used to defend their\\nscience were stories of alleged successful transmutations.\\nTestimonials by renowned scholars were popular (5);\\nbut also various artifacts of precious metals, allegedly\\nproduced by transmutation, kept in cabinets of curiosi-\\nties, were common in European castles since the Re-\\nnaissance (22).  The major part of Die Edelgeborne deals\\nwith stories of this kind. From the most widely known\\nepisodes are those about Helvetius [Johann Friedrich\\nSchweitzer], Johann Böttger, Alexander Seton,\\nParacelsus, Nicolas Flamel, Arnald from Villanova,\\nAlbertus Magnus, Johann Kunckel, Basil Valentin, Rob-\\nert Boyle, the Saxonian Elector Augustus and his wife\\nAnna, and David Beuthers. Particular attention is  paid\\nto the Emperor Rudolf II and two outstanding figures of\\nhis time, Edward Kelley and John Dee; but even the\\nimpostor Domenico Manuel Caetano is included in this\\nchapter.  Baron von Chaos, Wenzel Seyler, Ramon Lully,\\nand General Paykull are involved in accounts of coins\\nor medals being struck from the alleged alchemical\\nmetal. Cited from Reyher (23) are cases of coinage from\\nthe cities of Erfurt, Mainz, and Gotha.\\nIII. Ob man einige experimenta habe, aus welchen\\ndie Möglichkeit der Verwandlung der Metallen kan\\nabgenommen werden? (Whether there are any experi-\\nments from which a possibility of change of metals can\\nbe deduced?); pp 307 - 349.  Creiling, a practicing al-\\nchemist himself, cites some experiments from other\\nsources; but more valuable are the comments based on\\nhis own observations. In expounding on his own view\\nof the composition of matter, Creiling describes the state\\nof alchemy in its final stage.\\nIV. Was von der Medicina Universali, dem Auro\\npotabili, u.d.g. zu halten seye? (What should be thought\\nof Medicina Universalis, Auro potabili, and the like?);\\npp 350 - 384).  Creiling’s discussion of the medicinal\\nproperties and the use of the “universal medicine,” as\\nhe denoted the potable gold, is not quite clear; his inter-\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n53\\nest was primarily focused on the transmutation of met-\\nals.\\nV. Ob die Alchymia jemanden, und besonders\\ngrossen Herren zu rathen seye? (Whether Alchymia\\nshould be recommended to anybody, particularly to\\nlords?); pp 385 - 396). For centuries, alchemy had been\\nthe domain of the aristocracy; only later did wealthy\\nburghers participate. Here Creiling poses the general\\nquestion of the position of alchemy in his time. This\\nscience, considered as donum dei, was supposed to be\\naccessible solely to those chosen by God. At the end of\\nthe book two short descriptions of alchemical processes\\nare given (24), followed by the list (25) enumerating\\nallegedly successful acts performed through the art of\\nalchemy.\\nCreiling’s Defense of Alchemy\\nIt was a difficult task to defend alchemy in the first half\\nof the 18th century, for strong arguments posed by its\\nopponents had gradually prevailed by that time.  Creiling\\nchose to respond to five of the most common objections\\nby opponents of this science that appeared with increas-\\ning frequency in the previous few centuries.  Each of\\nCreiling’s arguments will be dealt with separately be-\\nlow.\\nThe first objection against alchemy entertained by\\nCreiling was the claim that different species created by\\nGod cannot be mutually changed. For example, the op-\\nponents say that an apple tree cannot be transformed\\ninto a cherry tree (26).  Creiling’s argument on this point\\nis crucial, because it touches on the very basic tenet of\\nalchemy:  whether transmutation is indeed possible at\\nall.  In an effort to provide a convincing positive an-\\nswer, alchemists had collected arguments for support of\\ntransmutation over centuries.\\nIn the Hellenistic world (27, 28), it was believed\\nthat the Aristotelian elements, the supposed constituents\\nof matter, could be mutually transformed by the change\\nof one quality. Jabir (who will be considered the author\\nof Jabirian corpus in this paper) defended a similar ap-\\nproach in his detailed explanation of the “inner” and\\n“outer” qualities of metals (29). Theoretically, transmu-\\ntation was thus considered a quite possible process, but\\nthis led to a second question: could everything indeed\\nbe mutually transformed, or are there certain limits?\\nAlong with this theoretical support alchemists needed\\npractical proof that transmutation can be achieved by\\nhumans.  Alchemical literature abounds in discussions\\nof transmutations effected by some external interven-\\ntion, usually by a miraculous substance such as the\\nphilosopher’s stone, elixir, etc. These examples pertained\\nalmost exclusively to metals.  As stated by Al-Iraqi (ac-\\ntive in the 13th cent. AD) (30):\\nWe say and maintain that two species of natural things\\nwhich differ radically and essentially cannot be\\nchanged and converted into the other by the Art, as,\\nfor example, man and the horse. But these six bodies\\ncan be mutually converted: thus lead may be con-\\nverted into silver,...” [as the six bodies gold, silver,\\ncopper, iron, lead, and tin are enumerated in the pre-\\nceding paragraph of the text].\\nWhile there was no doubt that the mutual change of\\nmetals occurred with an external agent, other chemical\\nreactions which could be performed without any such\\nagent were mistakenly understood as transmutations.\\nThe striking example of the reduction of metallic cop-\\nper on the surface of iron from cupric solutions misled\\neven as highly skilled a craftsman as Lazarus Ercker\\n(1528/30 - 1594) (31).  Another process that could have\\nsupported belief in transmutation was cupellation (32),\\nbecause it could be misinterpreted as the change of a\\npart of lead into silver. In Renaissance Europe, cupella-\\ntion was already a very sensitive method to detect even\\nsmall impurities in precious metals declared by some\\nalchemists to be the purest preparation [for the methods\\nof the alleged transmutation see Karpenko (33)]. Even\\nmore intriguing is the fact that alchemy attained one of\\nits greatest efflorescences by that time: it is enough to\\nremember the Rudolfian era in Bohemia (34).  A seem-\\ningly unlimited possibility for the transmutation of met-\\nals was thus confirmed.\\nLater, however, doubts about transmutation arose\\nfrom the realm of chemical reactions. For example,\\nAlexander von Suchten (? 1520 - ? 1590) (35) excluded\\nthe possibility of transmutation of copper to gold, and\\nlead to tin (36), but without explaining why.  The erro-\\nneous explanation of valid observations led Robert Boyle\\n(1627 - 1691) to the conclusion that there exist chemi-\\ncal reactions, such as the alloying of metals, in which\\nthe components forming a given substance remain un-\\nchanged, as, for example, when various metals are al-\\nloyed.  On the other hand, he explained the synthesis of\\nlead acetate as a transmutation, because it did not de-\\ncompose into the original constituents in subsequent\\ndistillation (37).  This approach to argumentation in fa-\\nvor of alchemy, based on gaps in contemporary chemi-\\ncal knowledge, persisted until the 19th century. An ex-\\ncellent example is given by Schmieder (38), who claimed\\nthat alchemists must not be misled by the argument their\\n54\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nopponents usually use: Species in speciem non mutatur.\\nAccording to him the opponents say that it is unlikely\\nthat oxygen could be changed into carbon, and there-\\nfore, the same should be valid for the probability that\\nlead or silver could become gold. In Schmieder’s opin-\\nion, the fact that pure metals  [regulinische Metalle] are\\nnot divisible [he means into their supposed elementary\\nconstituents] is nothing more than an assumption based\\nsolely on experience; but it is far from the truth (39):\\nThe inability to decompose them [metals] does not\\nmean the impossibility.\\nHe further gives the argument that bodies belonging to\\none class have something in common.  Acids, for ex-\\nample, extracted from plants all contain oxygen, car-\\nbon, and hydrogen. The proportion of these elements,\\nand of possible additional elements, determine the re-\\nsulting type of acid. Likewise, nobody doubts  the chemi-\\ncal similarity in the family of metals, and thus there must\\nbe something common contained in them as well.  It is,\\naccording to Schmieder (40), “Mercurius, or however\\nwe want to call it.”\\nWhile the intervention of an external agent seemed\\nto prevail in the transmutation of metals, quite a differ-\\nent kind of process could be invoked by nature. Even in\\nancient times, a belief existed that flies are born from\\nfouling flesh, and this phenomenon entered alchemical\\nliterature as an example of transmutation.  Latin Geber\\n(41) writes that a strangled calf changes into bees and a\\ndead dog into worms.  Later, less extreme and thus more\\nconvincing examples were brought in as arguments, the\\nmost spectacular being van Helmont’s (1577 - 1644)\\nexperiment with a willow tree, seemingly proof that\\nwater can be transmuted into wood (42).  Boyle, who\\nrepeated the same experiment, but with a shorter dura-\\ntion, arrived at a somewhat less optimistic conclusion\\n(43).   Quite another kind of example of a change in-\\nduced by nature appears in the treatise of Fabre (1588-\\n1658) (44, 45).  The author observes that for millennia\\npeople accepted as a matter of fact that all food and\\ndrinks taken into their bodies are transformed either into\\nred human flesh or to blood of the same color.  This,\\naccording to Fabre, supports the idea that a stone exists\\nwhich is able to produce a red or white color in metals.\\nThese second kinds of processes, induced by na-\\nture, were modeled from the observation of living mat-\\nter, when no apparent external intervention of a myste-\\nrious substance was involved, unlike the transmutation\\nof metals with the aid of the philosopher’s stone.  Yet\\nthe natural processes were less readily accepted, as ex-\\nemplified in Schmieder’s words (46);   he found it more\\nsuprising when apricots are found growing on a grafted\\nplum tree than when metals are made more precious.  In\\nusing natural phenomena to argue against transmutation,\\nNicolas Guibert (? 1547 - ? 1620) stated that various\\nmembers, even of the same species, cannot be changed,\\neither by nature or by art (47).  He compared the disap-\\npearance of members of the animal and mineral king-\\ndom, using as representative examples, respectively, a\\nhorse and the metal lead.  The horse disappears through\\ndeath, an irreversible process; conversely, the death of\\nlead is its calcination, which is reversible because the\\nmetal can be recovered from its oxide.\\nFrom the above examples it can be seen that alche-\\nmists could defend their ideas by citing natural or exter-\\nnally induced transformations; and this is what Creiling\\nactually did when he defended alchemy. In his comments\\n(48), he stressed that the words “species” and “genus”\\nare “school-words” [Schulwörter] that should be under-\\nstood as technical terms only, not as symbols of limits\\nof possible changes. When an animal, say a cow, feeds\\non grass, some amount of this grass is transformed into\\nthe flesh of this animal. There occurs thus a certain kind\\nof transmutation. Because the differences between met-\\nals are much smaller than those between living things,\\nthe transmutation of metals should be easier, and there-\\nfore, quite a plausible process. The analogy with a cow\\nis due to Fabre (45), although Creiling does not men-\\ntion this author.  Either he did not know Fabre’s book,\\nor else this kind of argument was so widely accepted\\namong the contemporary alchemical community that he\\nfelt no need to cite a source.\\nOver the whole span of alchemy, divine influence\\nwas considered as playing an important, sometimes even\\ncrucial, role in this activity. Surprisingly, Creiling, as\\nlate as the first half of the 18th century, emphasizes\\nstrongly the religious aspects in the three remaining ar-\\nguments in defense of alchemy.\\nThe second objection addressed by Creiling is the\\nobservation that the alchemical literature contains many\\ncontradictory assertions concerning the possibility of\\ntransmutation. This literature indeed abounds with con-\\ntradictions:  the philosopher’s stone is described by some\\nas a solid substance, by others as a liquid;  information\\nabout the duration of transmutation varied widely (from\\ndays to months); and statements on the technical details\\nof the “Great Work” itself were often conflicting.  While\\nCreiling acknowledges the existence of discrepancies,\\nhe argues  that there are discrepancies even in the words\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n55\\nof God in Scriptures and yet nobody doubts their truth.\\nAccording to him the same is true with alchemy; in this\\nscience the discrepancies are only illusory, and there is\\none truth hidden behind them.  Discrepancies and illeg-\\nible segments in alchemical texts, dating from early\\ntimes, is usually explained as an intentional device to\\nlimit use of the treatises to initiated readers, and pur-\\nposely to make the texts inaccessible to outsiders.  The\\nChinese Taoist scholar Ko Hung (approx. 280 - 340 AD)\\nexpressed this attitude quite clearly many centuries ago\\n(49):\\nI therefore compose this book solely to inform con-\\nnoisseurs.\\nCreiling does not comment on discrepancies as an in-\\ntentional corruption of information but rather takes re-\\ncourse in a unique religious argument, which seems\\noutdated at the dawn of the European Enlightenment.\\nAccording to him even the most sacred text is an ex-\\nample of confusion; but he pursues the idea no further.\\nShortly before Creiling, in his comments on the later\\nedition (1725) of Fabre’s book, Horlacher used the clas-\\nsical alchemical explanation (50):\\n.…one has not to look at and to take notice of the\\nrecipe (or process), but of the secret meaning of the\\nphilosophical sentences of this teaching....\\nThis was a typical approach used since Ko Hung’s time;\\nthe potential adept has to search behind the letters of the\\ntext.\\nIt was not an easy task to reject the third objection\\nto alchemy:  centuries of failures.  According to nonbe-\\nlievers, “this science has been nothing but a sweet\\ndream.”   To counter this argument, Creiling repeats tra-\\nditional claims of the alchemists but includes two con-\\nditions. First, none can learn alchemy alone but must be\\ninitiated by a Master of the Art, who can decipher the\\nsecret language.  Here Creiling, who describes himself\\nas a true alchemist, seemingly contradicts his claims\\nfrom the introductory part of his book: namely, that,\\nhaving revealed his teacher as a deceiver, he continued\\nto study alone. This apparent contradiction is explained\\nby the second condition: good fortune with the teacher\\nalone does not guarantee eventual success, because al-\\nchemy is a gift of God.  Thus, only God selects the people\\nwho will succeed in the Great Art. This motif of alchemy\\nas donum dei, which appeared in the Hellenistic world,\\nplayed an important role during the whole alchemical\\nera (51).  According to his own claims, Creiling ranked\\nhimself among those who had been selected by God,\\nfor he was able to succeed solely by studying books (52).\\nThe fourth objection to alchemy is a religious one.\\nIs it not a sin to perform alchemy?  If indeed, according\\nto Old Testament doctrine, everything created by God\\nwas good (53), any attempt to improve it could be looked\\nupon as claiming oneself to be higher than God, or in\\nother words, that God’s work was not perfect.  If, how-\\never, alchemy is seen as donum dei,  to what extent are\\nmortals allowed to use this divine gift, if at all?  Intense\\nreligious alchemical views are given in Siebmacher’s\\ntreatise.  This author rejects the idea that alchemy could\\nhave been a sort of  black art exercised by the powers of\\nhell (54).  He nevertheless warns that Satan, “that grim\\npseudo-alchymist” lies in wait; that only true faith in\\nGod leads to success. It is an obvious attempt to dis-\\ntance alchemy from everything that smacked of sorcery\\nand black magic, at the time of the last wave of witch\\nhunts in central Europe (55).  Siebmacher even went so\\nfar as to identify the philosopher’s stone with Jesus Christ\\n(56):\\nWe shall thus understand that the earthly philosophi-\\ncal Stone is the true image of the real, spiritual, and\\nheavenly Stone Jesus Christ.\\nCreiling responds to this religious objection with a prac-\\ntical example (57).  Would it be a sin if gold were made\\nfrom iron, which, like other metals, is in itself already\\nperfect because it serves people?   His negative answer\\nis justified by the creation of a yet more noble metal.\\nHe chooses two other examples which he describes as\\ntransmutations:  the formation of beautiful red cinnabar\\nfrom mercury and sulfur and creation of a deep blue\\ncolor from black cobalt.  Such processes are not sinful,\\naccording to Creiling, because nobody objects to them.\\nHe still regarded as transmutations the very same chemi-\\ncal processes that many of his contemporaries already\\nexplained as changes different from transmutation.  In\\nfact, it was  the synthesis of cinnabar and production of\\nother salts that eventually led researchers to the idea of\\na chemical compound.  Yet Creiling rejects as transmu-\\ntation attempts where alloys are made only to resemble\\ngold, calling them “a common practice.”  The “true”\\nalchemy is thus the real transmutation, the change of\\nthe substance.\\nThe last point is not an objection against alchemy\\nbecause it is based upon the a priori principle of the\\ntransmutation of metals.  Rather it raises the question of\\nthe efficiency of alchemists over nature.  While nature\\nneeds millennia to bring metals to full perfection, the\\nalchemist claims to simulate in a laboratory the same\\nmetallic processes within a substantially shorter time,\\nthe length of a human life.  The ancient conception of\\n56\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nripening of metals in the bowels of earth (58) was re-\\nflected in the writings of as skilled an expert as\\nVannoccio Birunguccio (1480 - 1539), who, in his\\nPirotechnia, comments on the formation of antimony\\n(59):\\n…..it might be a material that is about to reach me-\\ntallic perfection, but is hindered from doing so by\\nbeing mined too soon.\\nGeorgius Agricola (1494 - 1555) writes in De Re\\nMetallica in a similar way about the generation of met-\\nals by nature (60).\\nCreiling’s comment on this point (61) is not quite\\nconvincing.  While he stresses the necessity of artificial\\nintervention, in this case by an alchemist, he carefully\\navoids the very basis of this objection:  the acceleration\\nof the human over the natural processes.  He compares\\nthe intervention of an alchemist to that of a gardener,\\nboth striving to bring conditions to perfection faster than\\nnature does.  Creiling’s rather reserved response may\\nhave reflected opposing opinions (62) which appeared\\nin the 18th century.   Common metals do form within the\\nearth, but nature then leaves them in a form unchanged\\nuntil the end (“until the end of the world”) and “does\\nnot work them further into gold.”\\nCreiling’s View of the Composition of Metals\\nand of Transmutation\\nThe composition of metals, indeed of matter in general,\\nwas a key question for alchemists, because they con-\\nstructed their theories of transmutation on its answer.\\nThree main theories were gradually proposed and\\nworked out: the Aristotelian theory of four elements,\\nthe sulfur-mercury theory attributed to Arabic alche-\\nmists, and, eventually, the Paracelsian tria prima: mer-\\ncury, sulfur, and salt [for details see Leicester (63)].  Over\\ntime, intertwined and more or less confused views de-\\nveloped in which the important role was attributed to\\nmercury, as a rule in its vaguely characterized “philo-\\nsophical” form and later, in the 17th century, also to anti-\\nmony (64).  Although significant progress in the chemi-\\ncal treatment of metals, especially in the production of\\ntheir salts, developed from the 16th century onward, yet\\nthe absence of a consistent theory of the composition of\\nmetals led inevitably to two opposing explanations of\\nthese transformations.  Either they were alchemical trans-\\nmutations or some process other than transmutation. It\\nwas during this transitional period that Creiling wrote\\nhis book, and in his discussion he had to deal with the\\nfundamental question of metallic composition.  Perhaps\\nit is surprising that Creiling, an experienced and dedi-\\ncated alchemist, does not propose any theory of his own\\nbut instead chooses among those already existing.  He\\nwas attracted to authors who proposed the existence of\\na larger number of basic principles than the classical\\nthree or four in order to solve the misunderstanding of\\nthe nature of chemical reactions.  Creiling writes in the\\nintroductory part of his Chapter III (65) that many al-\\nchemists are “blind” and do not understand anything\\nabout the real composition of metals.  He recommends\\nthe work of Andrea de Solea (66) as a correct explana-\\ntion.  According to Solea the body of metals [Metallische\\nCorpus] consisted of seven constituents: 1 earth [eine\\nErde], 2 stone [Stein], 3 earth-ashes [Erd-Asche], 4 earth-\\nliquids [Erden-Flüsse], 5 glass of earth refuse [Glas des\\nErden Müll], 6 color of earth [die Erden-Farb], 7 soot of\\nearth (der Erden-Ruß).  After enumerating these con-\\nstituents, Creiling continues (65):\\n...And when this Corpus, that is composed from these\\nseven pieces, is brought by the smelter’s hand from\\nfragile state to the ductile of metal, it [metal] comes\\nback to the hand of the alchemist, who decomposes\\nit again in its Cinereum, Calicem, Laterem, Vitrum,\\nColorem, Fulginem, Subterraneas.\\nThis sentence illustrates the status of late alchemists,\\nwho actually studied the reactivity of metals. They con-\\nsidered salts and oxides produced in these reactions to\\nbe the constituents present originally in metals.  Creiling\\njudged that the author who explained this “anatomia\\nmetallorum” in an excellent way was F. Clinge (67);\\ntherefore, he reproduces in full the passage on copper\\nanatomy from that work, a set of chemical reactions that\\nare difficult to characterize now because of the obscure\\nlanguage of the alchemists. These reactions led to eight\\nalleged constituents of copper; the additional one to\\nSolea’s classification being the caput mortuum.  Clinge,\\nhowever, supposed that the true basic constituents of\\nmetals were solely the three Paracelsian principles. His\\nclassification of “anatomia veneris” was as follows: 1\\nsoul [Anima], 2 terra benedicta of the soul, or the soul\\nof Mercurius [der Anima Terra benedicta, nemlich die\\nAnima oder Mercurius], 3 sulfur, or the other principle,\\n4 its earth-color that shows which dress sulfur carries\\nconcealed under its blue color [seine Erd=farbe, die da\\nanzeiget, was vor Kleidung der Schwefel unter seiner\\nblauen Farbe verborgen trage], 5 the earthglass-flux [das\\nErdglas-Flux], 6 soot of metals [den Metallen Ruß], 7\\nsalt, or the third principle, 8 caput mortuum, or terra\\ndamnata. According to Clinge, there were three prin-\\nciples that actually comprise a metal, while the rest of\\nthe enumerated components were “excrementa.”  Their\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n57\\nnumber varied among different metals:  gold was pure;\\nit consisted solely of the three principles, while silver\\ncontained a bit of earth, and iron much more coarse earth.\\nIn their attempts to save their science, alchemists\\ncould not ignore the similar works done by chemists,\\nand Creiling was no exception.  That he was also ac-\\nquainted with contemporary trends in chemistry is shown\\nin his comment (68):\\nAt our time Becher has devised his Terras, and fa-\\nmous Mr Stahl explained them better than Becher\\ncould do, but the obscurity of principles\\n(Principiorum) and confusion of names persist like\\nbefore: some used to call Arsenic what others call\\nMercurium, the third [ones] Sulfur, the fourth [ones]\\nAlumen Fumosum, or some call it even Sal\\nMetallicum,... What, after all, depends on a name?\\nCreiling took Becher’s terra pinguis to be only one fur-\\nther species among many “earths” that confused alche-\\nmists and chemists and thus did not warrant much at-\\ntention.  After Creiling describes at length this view of\\nthe composition of metals, the question remains as to\\nwhat he actually understands metallic transmutation to\\nbe.  In his words, he, as a true philosopher, does not care\\nabout the wrangle over words [Wort=gezänck] when\\nalchemists try to describe transmutation because most\\nof them know nothing about it.  He gives this definition\\n(69):\\nI understand under transmutation of metals nothing\\nelse, than an extraordinary gift from God, or the Art,\\nthrough which one gets another [metal] instead of\\nthe [original] one, should it happen through the im-\\nmediate change, or not, be this metal present before\\nhidden in the other [metal], or be it through compo-\\nsition, or another transposition of particles\\n[particulen], or coarctation and a change of Pororum,\\nor [through] a violent action of a common substance,\\nor a substance that penetrates metallic spirit, which\\n[substance] can separate the heterogeneity and col-\\nlect homogeneous [being], or even through the al-\\nmighty miraculous hand of God, or in any known or\\nunknown way.\\nIn his polemic against opponents of alchemy, called here\\n“philosophi,” Creiling  recommends (70):\\nShould these Herren Philosophi also creep once into\\nthose ore mines and try to pay a little attention to the\\nway metals are growing, they would find with all\\n[ores] a fatty mercurialish-metallic, I would say a\\ngoldish nature,....\\nHe was convinced that the ability to ripen into gold was\\nhidden in all metals as an a priori attribute of inherent\\n“goldish nature.”  Transmutation was hence simply a\\nprocess that served to  enhance this ability.\\nCreiling’s comment on the possibility of mutual\\nchanges of metals (Chapter III) is based on gilding by\\namalgam (71).  Yet, as he notes, gilding is only a me-\\nchanical action that does not touch the interior of a metal.\\nWhen, however, a metal is attenuated [attenuirt] through\\nthe action of Mercurium Physice (no detailed explana-\\ntion of this process is given), then even a minute amount\\nof the tincture can penetrate its pores [Poros].  Accord-\\ning to Creiling, this tincture is nothing other than a puri-\\nfied and liquefied gold, attenuated through the action of\\nmercury.  This substance should then penetrate the\\n“minimas atomos” of liquid metals like wax or oil and\\nturn these metals into gold.\\nThese comments of Creiling deserve particular at-\\ntention because they are a reflection of corpuscular views\\nthat had already appeared in the works of the Latin Geber\\n(72).  The idea that some substance, by entering the pores\\nof another substance, changes the latter into something\\nnew was to Creiling a process that could be compared\\nwith the coloring of white wine with a dark juice from\\nred grapes.  As Creiling points out, however, it could be\\nobjected that in this case the substance being changed\\nwas wine from the very beginning, unlike mercury, lead,\\ntin, copper, or silver, which are not types of gold. Creiling\\ncounters this objection by the argument that all the enu-\\nmerated substances are metals, just as wine is always\\nwine, whether red or white. Thus, according to Creiling,\\nthe transmutation of metals is possible just as the con-\\nversion of white to red wine.  At the same time, Creiling\\nnevertheless rejects Becher’s speculation that gilded sil-\\nver wire when extended can be transmuted into gold.\\nHe explains that in this case it is only a mechanical ac-\\ntion during which nothing enters the pores of silver and,\\ntherefore, no transmutation  can occur.\\nCreiling between Alchemy and Chemistry\\nFrom his writing Creiling appeared to vacillate between\\ndefending and doubting alchemy, a reflection of the state\\nof matters in the 18th century, a period in which alchemy\\nwas still sufficiently strong to afford some convincing\\narguments in favor of transmutation. At the same time\\nthere was a growing number of observations that forced\\neven such devoted alchemists as Creiling to “alter” or\\n“adjust” their opinions. Several examples from Chapter\\nIII of Die Edelgeborne will be presented in more detail\\nin order to shed light on Creiling’s tenuous position be-\\ntween alchemy and chemistry.\\nCreiling (73) repeats the story noted by Morhof\\n(74), according to which “through the action of a com-\\n58\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nmon sulfur, gold is extracted from copper, or it even\\nripens within copper.” This story tells of an artisan who\\nmelted down one zentner [old unit; in Creiling’s time\\nusually 51 - 58 kg] of copper and added sulfur repeat-\\nedly to the molten metal in order to bring it to “ripe-\\nness.”  When he returned sometime later, he found ten\\nounces of the purest gold.  Creiling accepts this story as\\nproof of transmutation, but the account is actually sec-\\nond-, if not third-hand, perhaps being originally a real\\nand reasonable method, namely the separation of met-\\nals with sulfur. As early as the 12th century Theophilus,\\nin his treatise On Divers Arts (75), described a method\\nto separate gold from silver by use of sulfur, which was\\nto be added to the molten mixture of both metals “for\\nthe sulfur does not consume any of the gold, but only\\nthe silver...”  Here, there is a metallurgical technique\\nwhich could have been misinterpreted and eventually\\ntransformed into the account described by Creiling.\\nExtraction of gold from silver with sulfur and a small\\namount of copper, described, for example, by\\nBiringuccio (76), could well be the basis for another\\npurported transmutation.\\nThe second account in Chapter III illustrates\\nCreiling’s exact approach to experiments; it is based on\\nhis attempt to verify a supposed transmutation process\\nhe found elsewhere, the heating of cinnabar [HgS] with\\nfine silver filings, as described in 1684 by Freiherr\\n(Baron) Wilhelm von Schröder, who stood in high es-\\nteem in the German alchemical community (77). In spite\\nof the obscure style, a reader can surmise that during\\nthe heating, a material sublimes and a black substance\\nappears. The blackish substance, supposed to be cinna-\\nbar by Schröder, was apparently black Ag2S.  As a cer-\\ntain amount of cinnabar decomposed, mercury sublimed.\\nVon Schröder found the products of this reaction to be\\n“peculiar,” but nevertheless, he considered the process\\nto be the transmutation of cinnabar into silver.  The recipe\\ngains importance by virtue of Creiling’s commentary as\\na result of his own experimentation.  Creiling, the firm\\nbeliever in transmutation of metals, was sure that, con-\\ntrary to von Schröder’s opinion, no transmutation oc-\\ncurred in this particular case.  He writes (78):\\n...some 20 years ago being curious I performed this\\nlast experiment and found that no transmutation of\\ncinnabar is happening here (as is usually supposed,\\nand Herr Schröder seems to cling to this opinion),\\nbut solely silver precipitates in the shape of cinnabar\\nparticles, and of the whole silver as much goes off as\\nthe little particles weigh,  I will not keep it from an\\ninterested reader, but will faithfully remind so that\\nnobody here can be deceived by it...\\nCreiling’s experiment bore a feature of modern chemis-\\ntry, a quantitative approach, less than half a century af-\\nter Schröder’s recipe.  Creiling had happened upon a\\nquantitative approach as is obvious from his statement\\n“... as the little particles weigh...” and was convinced it\\nwas not transmutation, not the change of the essence of\\nsilver, as is expressed from his words that “silver pre-\\ncipitates in the shape of cinnabar.”  In other words, no\\nsilver was lost.  Creiling might have applied the same\\nquantitative approach to other reactions as well and ar-\\nrived at the general conclusion against transmutation.\\nThe time was not yet ripe for such discovery, however,\\nand Creiling did not view this one exception sufficient\\nto shatter his conviction.  Creiling tried to explain the\\nreaction of cinnabar by comparing it to that between\\niron and copper (II) sulfate, one of the pillars of alchemy,\\nseemingly an unshakable proof of transmutation (79).\\nSurprisingly, Creiling the fervent alchemist did not con-\\nsider this crucial reaction to be transmutation, although\\nhe does not explain how he arrived at such a revolution-\\nary conclusion. The first attempts to prove that this re-\\naction is not transmutation appeared in the beginning of\\nthe 17th century, but they remained unnoticed (80).  Even\\nlater, Boyle’s explanation (81) of this process did not\\nshatter the belief of loyal alchemists so that, for example,\\nHorlacher (82) held firmly to the position that iron can\\nbe transmuted into copper.  Nearly 70 years later, a trea-\\ntise appeared dealing exclusively with vitriol; here, in\\nthe sixteenth experiment, this reaction is characterized\\ncorrectly as the precipitation of copper on the surface of\\niron (83).  Yet at about the same time Baron Tschoudy,\\nin his Alchemical Catechism (84), wrote that “Mars can\\nbe easily converted into Venus” but “not Venus into\\nMars.”\\nFurther on in Chapter III (85)  Creiling cites “an\\neasy experiment” from Laurentius Meisner (86), which\\nshould convince any skeptic of the validity of alchemy.\\nA mixture of galmei [ZnCO3], vitriol [CuSO4], and sul-\\nfur should be distilled and the “water” prepared in this\\nway should be poured to “solutio Lunae.”  A black pow-\\nder precipitated from this solution should produce gold\\nwhen melted with borras [borax ?].  In this typical al-\\nchemical recipe, quite difficult to decipher, one can only\\nspeculate that the  black powder is the highly insoluble\\nAg2S.  Yet, the recipe continues: “Pour common water\\nunder the other water and throw a sheet of copper into\\nit, whereupon a beautiful deposit of silver calx falls to\\nthe bottom;  pour the water out, so thou hast thine silver\\nagain…” This text apparently describes the reduction\\nof silver from its solution by metallic copper, as expected\\nfrom the electrochemical potentials of the two metals.\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n59\\nCreiling writes that the deposited metal is silver, thus\\nthe “water” used for this second experiment was a part\\nof “solutio Lunae.”  The last sentence of this paragraph\\nexplains the aim of these experiments “.....quod\\nAlchymia & Metallorum transmutatio sit ars verissima.”\\nIn contrast  to Creiling’s conclusion that this is a trans-\\nmutation, N. Guibert (47) carried out a similar experi-\\nment with the intention  of disproving transmutation.\\nIn another experiment (87) described  by Creiling\\nin Chapter III,  he presents himself as a devout alche-\\nmist.  When a mixture of Luna cornea [AgCl] and half\\nits weight of sal ammoniac [NH4Cl] is sublimed, there\\nis produced a light-yellow “flores,” a sublimate ascend-\\ning to the top of the vessel and deposited there. When\\ntapped at the top, these “flowers” fall into the melted\\nluna cornea which turns immediately to “the most beau-\\ntiful goldish color.”  This is nothing more than the melt-\\ning of silver chloride whose fused form, as “luna cor-\\nnea” or “horn silver,” turns from a yellow substance into\\na transparent, viscous orange-yellow liquid (88).  At most\\nthe addition of ammonium chloride to the dry substance\\nmight make the color less intense because of its own\\nwhite color.  According to Creiling, pure gold can be\\nextracted from this luna cornea after its reduction, al-\\nthough he gives no details of this process and offers no\\nquantitative data.  Perhaps this experienced chemist con-\\nsidered the process to be transmutation because he iso-\\nlated minute amounts of gold, present as impurity in his\\nsample of luna cornea.  He closes this paragraph with\\nthe telling words, “Yet, one has not to expect any profit\\nof it, but only the exploration of truth and a stimulus to\\nfurther philosophical observations.”\\nIn Chapter IV of his book, Creiling discusses\\n“medicina universalis (89).”  He is willing to accept a\\nsubstance as a “universal medicine” provided it removes\\neverything harmful from the body and blood.  He thinks,\\nhowever, that there is not just one, but there may be\\nmany such medicines; and that such a medicine, con-\\ntrary to the claim of Arnald from Villanova (90), can\\nnot cure all illnesses simultaneously.  In Creiling’s opin-\\nion, significant differences between “universal medi-\\ncines” exist;  there is only one that cures and purifies\\nmetals from their imperfect state to the “health of gold”\\n(Gesundheit des Goldes), but he doubts whether one\\nmedicine could exist which would act similarly on the\\nhuman body, the reason being that, contrary to metals,\\nscientists do not know the actual cause of human life or\\nunderstand what keeps humans alive.\\nThis last point shows Creiling to be a man who stood\\nat the threshold between alchemy and chemistry and\\napparently interested in iatrochemistry.  Rather careful\\nconcerning the possibilities of universal medicine, he\\nwas of the opinion that, contrary to metals, the compo-\\nsition and function of the human body are not sufficiently\\nunderstood.  He could not suspect that the same was\\ntrue for metals as well in his time.\\nConclusions\\nDie Edelgeborne Jungfer Alchymia belongs to those\\nworks that allow deeper insight into the final stage of\\nEuropean alchemy.  In the closing chapter of his book,\\nCreiling, a believer in alchemy, did not search for causes\\nof its failures within alchemy itself.  In his opinion, the\\ncause was not in this science, but in the supposed re-\\nsults of alchemical activities, in promised material\\nriches, and longevity.  No wonder that anybody who\\nknew the Art was not willing to reveal its secret to those\\nnot familiar with alchemy.  Therefore, the only way was\\nto study on one’s own and try to understand the secret\\nof the Great Art; but whom will God enlighten that he\\nwill understand?  A motif of alchemy as donum dei ap-\\npears here once again and completes the circle. Can it\\nbe expected that anybody so enlightened, selected by\\nGod, would readily disclose this highest secret?\\nCreiling’s answer is at once negative but contradictory,\\nbecause he indeed discloses the secrets.\\nA further point to be stressed here is the question\\nof experimental results and the disposition of products\\nfrom the recipes he describes.  Warning that no riches\\ncan be expected, only a deeper understanding of natural\\nphenomena, he opines (91):\\n…..a journey to America has already helped many\\n100 people to great fortunes,... (while)...one should\\nexpect much less from one or other lucky effects,\\nwhich he gets through alchemy...one lucky among\\n100,000 unlucky laborants [alchemists] can be\\ncounted.\\nThis is a marked retreat from the position alchemy had\\noccupied in the late European Renaissance, when al-\\nchemists were cautious in their promises and sought\\nsupport from rich aristocracy.  There is no longer dan-\\nger in 1730, as there was three centuries before, when a\\nCzech alchemist wrote (92):\\n.…..beware thee of lords and of high [standing]\\npeople, lest thou shouldst not do anything [together]\\nwith them nor to rely upon their promises, because\\nthey upon seeing the immense work, nobody will do\\njustice to thee, because who has a power, that has a\\nlaw....\\n60\\nBull.

Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nIn the recent article (1) entitled “The Art of Distillation\\nand the Dawn of the Hydrocarbon Society” published\\nin the Bulletin for History of Chemistry, the author states\\nthat Edwin L. Drake (1819-1880) drilled at Titusville,\\nPennsylvania a well that produced crude oil on August\\n27, 1859. “Thus the oil industry began as we know it\\ntoday.”  In this connection, the present writer would like\\nto point out that the oil industry actually began one year\\nearlier in 1858 when the Canadian\\nentrepreneur James Miller Will-\\niams (1818-1890) (Fig. 1) drilled\\nand successfully produced oil in\\nthe township of Enniskillen be-\\ntween Lake Erie and Lake Huron\\nnear the town later named Oil\\nSprings in what is now Southwest\\nOntario.  In 1857 Williams had\\nbegun looking for oil on the banks\\nof the Thames River, at Bothwell.\\nUnsuccessful, he moved to the\\ngum beds of Enniskillen, Lambton\\nCounty.  On Black Creek, a tribu-\\ntary of the Sydenham River, he\\nextracted oil, yielding 5 to 100 bar-\\nrels of oil a day.  When drilling was\\nmade 100 feet below the rock, the\\nwell produced 60 barrels a day.\\nWilliams built a simple refinery on\\nthe banks of Black Creek, and his\\noperation, the J. M. Williams Com-\\npany, was actually North America’s\\nfirst oil company.  In 1860 his company became known\\nas the Canadian Oil Company.  Nearly a hundred wells\\nwere drilled in the area, and production averaged 20\\nbarrels a day.  In 1860 James Williams moved his refin-\\nery to Hamilton where he carried on business until he\\ndied in 1890 (2).\\nAlthough Canada had launched North America’s\\nfirst oil boom, developments in the\\nUnited States were taking place that\\nwould eventually overshadow Cana-\\ndian efforts.  When Drake drilled a\\nhole at Titusville and found oil at\\nabout 21 meters, he quickly took\\ncredit as being the “father” of the oil\\nindustry in North America.  By 1860,\\nthe US was producing over thirty\\ntimes the Canadian oil production.\\nThe “Gum Beds”\\nEven before Williams dug his well, the\\nsticky crude oil called “gum beds” of\\nthe area caused by oil seepage near\\nthe creek had been refined into as-\\nphalt, paints, and resins by native\\npeoples and had been reported by\\nearly French explorers.  In fact, the\\nworld’s first oil company, the Inter-\\nnational Mining and Manufacturing\\nCompany, had received its charter\\nTHE FIRST OIL WELL IN THE WORLD\\nFathi Habashi, Laval University\\nFigure 1.

Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n65\\nfrom the Canadian Parliament in 1854 to produce as-\\nphalt, varnishes, burning fluids, and caulking materials\\nfor ships.  Lack of transport for their products forced\\nthe owners to sell out to Williams, who took commer-\\ncial development a step further by digging a well which\\nproduced 50 barrels of oil per day in 1858.\\nPetrolia\\nA few kilometers north of Oil Springs is the small town\\nof Petrolia, which in its heyday was the richest little\\ntown in Canada.  Store shelves were stocked with ex-\\notic imports.  Wealthy oilmen, builders, and merchants\\nerected their fine mansions, an opera house, and a rac-\\ning track.  Oil field fires destroyed many early frame\\nbuildings.  As a result fire stations were as important to\\nthe community as the oil derricks.  The arrival of the\\nGreat Western Railway in 1858 and the commercial oil\\nfind at Oil Springs that same year led to dramatic growth\\nof Sarnia.  Refineries were built and oil arrived first by\\ntrain and in 1865 by wagon.  Refined and crude oil was\\nshipped as far as London and Liverpool in England.\\nIn 1862, at the height of the oil boom, Southwest-\\nern Ontario was called Canada West.  A plank road was\\nbuilt linking the “Oil Capital of the World,” Oil Springs,\\nwith Sarnia.  Regular stage coach lines covered the 25\\nmiles route four times a day.  It was a toll road that al-\\nlowed crude oil to be transported to Sarnia and to refin-\\ning centers beyond.  Paved sections of the historic thor-\\noughfare have become a principal route between Sarnia\\nand central Lambton County.\\nThe Oil Well Supply Company was founded in 1866\\nin Petrolia by Hector McKenzie, a machinist who later\\njoined forces with a blacksmith James Joyce, to manu-\\nfacture drill rings, special tools for the oil industry, as\\nwell as pumps and valves.  Petrolia was also the seat of\\n“Nitro” plants.  Nitroglycerine was used to “shoot” oil\\nwells to make them more productive.  The detonation\\ncaused by the explosive would crack the oil-bearing for-\\nmation and free more oil for production.  The manufac-\\nture and transport of the liquid explosive constituted a\\ndangerous business.  All the “Nitro” plants eventually\\nblew up.\\nOil wells were pumped dry; demand changed from\\ntime to time, and outside competition hurt the domestic\\nmarket.  In addition, the economic depression in the\\n1870s greatly slowed down the regional petroleum in-\\ndustry.  However, the slowdown in Canada was a boon\\nto other countries.  In 1874 the first contingent of Petrolia\\ndrillers left for Java, and others followed to Persia, Ro-\\nmania, Venezuela, Borneo, and Austria.  They took with\\nthem their tools, blueprints, their expertise, and deter-\\nmination.\\nFigure 2.   Location of North America’s first oil well in Oil Springs,\\nOntario (near Sarnia).

Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\nSarnia\\nNew oil and gas deposits are being discovered each year\\nthroughout southwestern Ontario and out in the Great\\nLakes.  At Sarnia, Canada’s “Chemical Valley,” are the\\nmost modern oil refineries, processing hundreds of thou-\\nsands of barrels of oil daily and the many satellite plants\\nprocessing its byproducts for thousands of uses.  The\\nBushnell refinery, the first along the river, built in 1871,\\nwas later bought by Standard Oil and eventually became\\nthe site of Imperial Oil’s modern refinery.  Other heavy\\nindustry, including foundries and manufacturing plants,\\nwas located nearby.  However, it was World War II that\\nstimulated growth within the construction of petrochemi-\\ncal industries.  The Japanese had cut off supplies of natu-\\nral rubber from the Far East and the Allies needed a\\nsubstitute.  Polymer Corporation (now Polysa) was  set\\nup next door to Imperial Oil to produce synthetic rub-\\nber from Imperial’s feedstock.\\nThe oil drilling technology developed in these fields\\nwas exported worldwide by local drillers.  Many of the\\noriginal oil and refining companies are still located in\\nnearby Sarnia.  Approximately 400 wells still produce\\noil from the fields where the boom began over a hun-\\ndred years ago.  In the past 100 years, local wells have\\nproduced over 10 million barrels of oil.  Experts believe\\nthat only a portion of the oil reserves has been tapped\\nand that the potential for additional production exists.\\nBiographical Note\\nWilliams was born September 14, 1818 in Camden, New\\nJersey of Welsh parentage.  He left school early and was\\napprenticed to a Camden carriage maker.  In 1840 his\\nfamily moved to London, upper Canada, when he was\\n22.  In 1842 he married and began a carriage manufac-\\nturing business.  In 1846 he moved to Hamilton and\\njoined the Hamilton Coach Factory.  When Williams sold\\nhis carriage interests in 1852, he served as a city alder-\\nman.  In 1856 he again sold his business and bought the\\nInternational Mining and Manufacturing Company. This\\noperation, on property called Victoria and later known\\nas Oil Springs, lasted for three or four years, but his\\ninterests were diverted when he began his quest for oil\\nin 1857.\\nAt the London Exhibition in 1862 Williams received\\ntwo medals: one for being the first to produce crude oil\\nand the second as the first to refine oils. In 1865-66,\\nwith a capital of $50,000, the company increased its\\nemployees and production.  An advertisement listed the\\nfirm as manufacturing illuminating and machinery oil;\\nand as wholesale dealers in benzine and coal oil lamps.\\nTheir celebrated product was “Victoria Oil.”  In 1867,\\nhe became Hamilton’s first provincial representative at\\nthe Ontario Legislature, on a Liberal ticket.  In 1870,\\nthe directory showed his office at 27 King Street West\\nand a refinery on the eastern limits, with his son and\\nJames Cummings as partners.  A year later, he appeared\\nas president of the Canadian Carbon Oil Company and\\nwas elected to parliament.\\nOn retirement from parliament in 1879 Williams\\nwas appointed Registrar for Wentworth, a post he held\\nuntil his death.  It appears that in 1880 he sold his oil\\ninterests in Hamilton and went into the metal stamping\\nindustry, one of the first to make stamped tin ware.  He\\ndied on November 25, 1890, at age 72.  He was buried\\nin the Hamilton Cemetery, Lot 6, E3.\\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\\n1.\\nM. D. Saltzman, “The Art of Distillation and the Dawn\\nof the Hydrocarbon Society,” Bull. Hist.

Benjamin Silliman Jr., who provided the analyses of the oil seeps, showed that by\\nfractional distillation a product equivalent to the kerosene then being made by destructive distil-\\nlation of coal could be obtained.  It must be remembered that by 1858 the kerosene for lighting\\nwas being produced in large quantities by the processes developed by the Canadian Abraham\\nGesner and the Scot James Young.  The Canadian well produced so little crude oil that it gained\\nmodest significance as a source of kerosene.  It is the vast amount of crude oil that was found in\\nPennsylvania that led to the decline of the coal oil industry and the rise of the extraction of oil as\\na major industry in the United States initially and very soon thereafter in other parts of the world.\\nMartin D.

In his\\nown day, learned men and women throughout Europe\\nknew his name as one of the most thoughtful English\\nproponents of the “new and experimental philosophy,”\\nmaking a visit to his laboratory an almost mandatory\\nstop on their tours of England.  Poor Boyle frequently\\nhad to entertain visitors, keeping him from the work to\\nwhich he otherwise devoted every day but Sunday.  He\\nand his assistants accomplished enough, however, to\\nmake his name well known still; his Sceptical Chymist\\nhas been in print almost constantly since it was first\\npublished in 1661. Boyle has recently recaptured the\\ninterest of historians as a representative of the kind of\\nscience pursued by the so-called virtuosi.  A virtual in-\\ndustry has come into being devoted to writing about the\\nscientific world of Boyle’s time as seen through the prism\\nof his life and work, while at the same time Michael\\nHunter and others have been busy scrutinizing, catalogu-\\ning, and publishing his voluminous manuscript papers.\\nThe works of Sargent and Wojcik were published\\nbefore their authors were able to take advantage of the\\nnew information emerging from Boyle’s papers, al-\\nthough they had glimpses of that new work, so their\\nbooks rely mainly on his published works for evidence\\nof his views.  It is well known, and acknowledged by\\nboth authors, that Boyle took great care to present his\\npolished pieces in a form that would give as little of-\\nfense as possible, so his first thoughts and more risky\\nhypothesizing seldom show up in his books.  Moreover,\\nhis potentially explosive opinions about the medical\\nestablishment of his time remain mostly hidden from\\nhis readers, while he is virtually silent on anything closer\\nto the centers of power.  Both authors are well aware\\nthat Boyle’s thoughts and his published words may not\\nbe identical.  Nevertheless, as accounts of Boyle’s pub-\\nlic  expressions, both books give us very balanced treat-\\nments, especially Sargent’s.\\nSargent attempts an overview of Boyle’s intellec-\\ntual world and the place of his thoughts within it, and as\\na result gives us the best general account of his ideas we\\nhave had in a generation or two.  She divides her analy-\\nsis into three parts.  In the first, the background scene in\\nphilosophy, law, and experimentalism is painted in broad\\nstrokes but with enough color to make it interesting.\\nBoyle’s religious outlook—he famously took up his\\nwork as a “Christian virtuoso”—is given in more detail\\nin the second part.  The third section takes up his ex-\\nperimental endeavors.  This last section will interest his-\\ntorians of science especially for Sargent’s tempered but\\nwell-considered criticisms of other recent accounts of\\nBoyle’s scientific practices; such comments are enough\\nso that readers who want simply to get a view of Boyle’s\\noutlook will likely not be distracted (although this re-\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n69\\nviewer found her several negative pronouncements about\\n“contextualist” history irritating).  All three sections find\\nSargent interpreting the words of Boyle and his prede-\\ncessors with confidence and ease.  She, like so many\\nothers, finds the center of his concerns to be in uncover-\\ning God’s creation so as to appreciate Him better through\\nhis works.  Religiously and temperamentally, he always\\nremained “diffident,” refraining from bold claims or\\ngeneralizations announced to be certain.  He was a\\nhumble experimental scientist, seeking the causes of\\nthings but remaining always prepared to reconsider hy-\\npotheses in the face of new evidence, which had to be\\ngathered through persistent and patient investigation.\\nSargent’s final and most detailed examples—from\\nBoyle’s investigations into the causes and consequences\\nof cold temperatures—illustrate very well the way in\\nwhich he struggled by experiment to stabilize and to\\nmake sense of the stunning variety of nature’s phenom-\\nena.  Sargent has produced an impressive synthesis from\\nBoyle’s best known published books and a few of his\\nlesser known treatises, although whether it well repre-\\nsents his more private work and thoughts is yet to be\\nseen.\\nThe theme of Boyle as a person whose experimen-\\ntal science emerged from his theological concerns is\\ndeveloped further in Wojcik’s book.  To the author, Boyle\\nis best assessed as a lay theologian, whose early reli-\\ngious education and eclectic reading turned him away\\nfrom full confidence in reason.  Some parties, most no-\\ntably the Socinians, argued that nothing in scripture con-\\ntradicted human reason; others, such as Hobbes and\\nSpinoza, developed rational systems that seemed to leave\\nno place for God, at least once the world was created.\\nThe development of such doctrines led away from reli-\\ngious conflict, but also away from Christian\\ntrinitarianism and other basic tenets of faith.  Boyle left\\na place in his heart and mind for mysteries beyond hu-\\nman comprehension—in this Wojcik agrees entirely with\\nSargent that he is well described as diffident.  But Wojcik\\ngoes farther.  A seldom examined treatise of Boyle’s,\\nThings Above Reason (1681), is the main text, supple-\\nmented with some of his other theological treatises.\\nFrom such works, Wojcik finds Boyle to be one who\\nhad doubts about the ability of reason to appreciate fully\\nthe wonders of God and his works.  Because of this,\\nBoyle considered evidence about the world gathered\\nthrough our senses and tested by considered experiments\\nto be the only way that one could come close to truth\\nabout creation and its creator.  In other words, the best\\npath toward comprehensive religious knowledge lay\\nthrough the senses rather than reason, coupled with an\\nacknowledgment that what we learn of the material\\nworld depends on a spiritual power that can be only in-\\nferred.  In limiting the powers of reason in this way,\\nBoyle had to depend on probabilistic conclusions rather\\nthan ones that had complete certainty.  His science was\\nnot that of a mathematical proof but of a close and ex-\\nacting description of phenomena suggesting as many\\nquestions as answers.\\nExactly what turned the young Boyle from moral\\nphilosophy and theology toward experimental science\\nin the mid 1640s is something we may never fully un-\\nderstand from the extant record.  Whether some line of\\nthought or inner experience might have been enough to\\nalter the focus of his work is open to question, as must\\nbe the issue of how much his science depended on his\\nreligious outlook.  That he saw no contradiction between\\nhis experimentalism and his faith is quite clear, unless\\none wants to take the position that he protested too much.\\nBoth Sargent and Wojcik take him at his word, and that\\nis probably best, at least until we know more from the\\nmanuscript sources.  As clear and learned interpretations\\nof  Boyle’s public professions in favor of a virtuous ex-\\nperimental science, both books can be highly recom-\\nmended.  Harold J.

To rectify this false perception, a workshop on\\nnatural dyestuffs history was held at Oriel College, Ox-\\nford, January 4-6, 1996, organized by Robert Fox, Pro-\\nfessor of History of Science at Oxford University.  Un-\\nder the sponsorship of the European Science Founda-\\ntion, a distinguished group gathered to discuss various\\naspects of natural dyestuffs.  This volume contains eleven\\npapers from the workshop and presents to the reader a\\ncomprehensive discussion of natural dyestuffs and the\\nindustry that developed around them.\\nThese papers deal with the subjects from the per-\\nspectives of the history of science, the history of tech-\\nnology, economic history, and the history of art to pro-\\nduce an integrated study at many levels.  These eleven\\npapers are divided into four main subject areas.  The\\nfirst deals with the question of whether there is really\\nany chemistry than can be associated with the natural\\ndyestuffs.  The second and third discuss questions con-\\ncerning the role of geography, the markets and the skills\\nof the workers in Europe exploiting natural dyes, and\\nthe role natural dyestuffs played in the development of\\nthe factory system.  The final section deals with the de-\\ncline of natural dyestuffs and the transition to the sci-\\nence-based synthetic dyestuff industry.  From the per-\\nspective of the chemist historian, the most satisfying\\nparts of this volume are the first and last sections.  The\\npapers in these sections will form the basis of this re-\\nview.\\nBernadette Bensaude-Vincent and Augusti Niete-\\nGalan open the volume with a paper, “Theories of dye-\\ning:  a view on a long-standing controversy through the\\nworks of Jean-Francois Persoz.”  Persoz (1805-1868)\\nwas involved in many theoretical controversies concern-\\ning the dyeing action of natural colorants.  A particu-\\nlarly vitriolic controversy occurred with Walter Crum\\n(1796-1867), a Scottish calico printer.   Beginning in\\nthe eighteenth century French chemists such as Charles-\\nFrancois Dufery, Pierre-Joseph Macquer, and Claude\\nLouis Berthollet contributed several treatises on dye-\\ning.  Whether the mechanism of dyeing was mechanical\\nor chemical in nature was at the heart of the various\\ncontroversies.  Macquer and Berthollet were the first to\\ndiscuss dyeing in terms of the ‘new chemistry’ with oxy-\\ngen as the agent of the changes in color and chlorine as\\na new bleaching agent.  Chemical affinity between the\\nfabric, the dye, and the solvent was implied to be the\\nreason for varying degrees of fixation of the dyes.\\nIn 1846 Jean-Baptise Dumas published his views\\non the theory of dyeing, in which he proposed that there\\ncould not be an exclusively physical or chemical expla-\\nnation.  In this same year Jean-Francois Persoz presented\\nhis own ideas in a four-volume work, Traite theoretique\\net pratique d’impression des tissues.  Persoz, a recog-\\nnized expert on dyes, served in several official positions\\nassociated with the dye industry.  As a chemist he was\\nvery much concerned with theoretical problems, espe-\\ncially molecular explanations.  He viewed chemical re-\\nactions as the result of the rearrangement of atoms in a\\nmolecule.  This put him on a collision course with Walter\\nCrum, who had studied chemistry with Thomas\\nThomson at Glasgow.  Crum succeeded Thomson in the\\nchair of chemistry at Glasgow in 1852.  Crum advo-\\ncated a purely mechanical view that the dye penetrated\\nthe fiber, while Persoz took the view that it was depos-\\nited on the surface and a reaction then occurred.  Crum\\nargued that, since cotton could be dyed without destruc-\\ntion of the fiber, the process had to be more mechanical\\nthan chemical.  Persoz insisted it was a chemical attrac-\\ntion between metal oxides in the fiber and the organic\\ndye that was responsible for the coloring.  Neither Persoz\\nnor Crum was able to convince the other, but the con-\\ntroversy is important in that it allowed the dyeing prob-\\nlem to be reformulated on a new physico-chemical ba-\\nsis.  Some of the details of the investigations that fol-\\nlowed are discussed in this paper.\\nThe papers by Gerard Empotz and Girolamo\\nRamunni in French, and hence less accessible to the gen-\\neral reader, round out this first section.  Ramunni pre-\\nsents a discussion of the controversy among French\\nchemists associated with the true coloring matter of the\\nred natural dyestuff madder or Turkey red.  In 1868,\\nCarl Graebe and Carl Liebermann synthesized alizarin,\\nthus establishing it as the key component of natural\\nmadder.  Rumanni chronicles disputes over the mecha-\\nnism of the natural dyeing process through a discussion\\nof papers that appeared in Annnales de chimie et de phy-\\nsique.  The end result of this research did not produce a\\ncomprehensive answer, but it stimulated significant work\\nthat would later be useful.\\nIn his paper, “Chimie des colorants et qualité des\\ncouleurs face au changement technique dans les années\\nBull. Hist. Chem., VOLUME 25, Number 1  (2000)\\n71\\n1860,” Gerald Empotz discusses the contributions of\\nPersoz, Michael-Eugene Chevrene, and Paul\\nSchutzberger  in the era that preceded the change to syn-\\nthetic dyestuffs.  These investigators were more inter-\\nested in the use of chemistry to establish quality control\\nthan in the potential of chemistry to create new dyes.\\nThey were fearful for the most part that synthetic dye-\\nstuffs would decimate an industry that was associated\\nwith so much artisan skill.  A general conclusion is that\\nthere may have been an attempt to use chemistry to ex-\\nplain the dyeing process but that there was no system-\\natic science of natural dyestuffs.\\nThe last three papers of the collection are of spe-\\ncial interest to the chemist historian.  Richard L. Hills\\npresents a fascinating study, “James Watt and Bleach-\\ning.”  Hills has studied Watt’s papers, which have only\\nrecently become available, to highlight this little known\\nfacet of Watt’s career.  This is concerned with the devel-\\nopment of a process to make chlorine in sufficient quan-\\ntities and at a suitable price so that it could be used com-\\nmercially for bleaching.  Watt maintained a lifelong in-\\nterest in chemistry and especially in its application to\\ncommercial ventures.  In a visit to Paris in 1786, Watt\\nlearned of the bleaching power of chlorine from its dis-\\ncoverer Berthollet.  Watt immediately recognized the\\npossibility of chlorine as a replacement for other meth-\\nods then being used to bleach cotton.  Watt’s father-in\\nlaw James McGregor, who was in the textile business in\\nGlasgow, became his partner in the venture.  Hill’s pa-\\nper describes Watt’s improvement of the Berthollet pro-\\ncess for preparing chlorine and the development of the\\nequipment to produce chlorine on a commercial scale.\\nOur lack of awareness of this aspect of Watt’s career,\\naccording to Hills, stems from the secrecy in which Watt\\nshrouded his operations to prevent their being copied\\nand stolen.  Others soon developed competing processes\\nto make chlorine; this venture never afforded the rewards\\nthat the steam engine did for Watt, to whom must be\\ngiven the long overdue credit for developing a chemical\\napparatus which could produce chlorine safely and eas-\\nily.\\nAnthony Travis presents a case study of the transi-\\ntion from natural to synthetic dyes through a discussion\\nof the career of Heinrich Caro (1834-1910).  Caro was\\nunique in that he was a chemically trained textile color-\\nist, whose early career in Germany was centered on natu-\\nral dyestuffs and the calico printing industry and who\\nmade the transition to the new synthetic dyestuffs.  In\\n1859, Caro left Germany to work at Rober, Dale & Co.\\nin Manchester, the center of the textile industry in En-\\ngland.  Initially Caro worked in natural dyestuffs, but\\nby 1862 he was completely involved in the new coal\\ntar-based aniline dyes discovered by Perkin in 1856.\\nOver the next five years Caro participated in the dis-\\ncovery of novel dyestuffs and finding more efficient\\nprocesses for products already on the market.  He also\\ndid technical service work for his employer.  Returning\\nto Germany in 1866, he worked with Bunsen at Heidel-\\nberg for two years until he joined BASF.  There Caro\\nwas instrumental in the development of azo dyes and\\nsynthetic indigo.  The many contributions made by\\nchemists such as Caro in producing new synthetic dyes\\nand understanding their chemistry led to the gradual\\ncollapse of the natural dyestuffs industry in many parts\\nof Europe by the 1880s.\\nChristian Simon, in “The transition from natural\\ndyestuffs to synthetic dyestuffs:  the case of Basel 1850-\\n1940,” shows that natural dyestuffs were not as quickly\\nreplaced by synthetic materials as is generally assumed.\\nHis paper is a case study of the firm J. R. Geigy, which,\\nfrom 1860-1940, operated two adjoining plants, one for\\nnatural and the other for synthetic dyes.  According to\\nSimon, there is an abundance of archival material to as-\\nsess how these two coexisting ventures fared.  The au-\\nthor presents a comprehensive history of the develop-\\nment of the Geigy Company and shows that there was a\\nlinkage between the natural and synthetic dyes at times\\nand that they complemented each other for almost eighty\\nyears.  By the 1940s natural dyes had essentially disap-\\npeared because their cost rendered them noncompeti-\\ntive.\\nAll the papers in this volume include extensive notes\\nwhich offer the reader further opportunities to explore\\nthe subjects in greater detail.
